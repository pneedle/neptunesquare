            \'value\' => "<p>Wolves live in groups called packs. A pack is a family of 7-8 wolves with a mom, dad, and offspring. The wolves\' communication skills are very important to the pack\'s survival. Wolves work together to hunt, raise their young, and protect their territory. Wolves communicate with more than howls. They whimper and whine, growl and bark, yelp and snarl. They also use scents produced by their bodies to communicate. A wolf’s sense of smell is 100 times stronger than a human’s. One source of scent is urine, which they use to mark territory and to tell other wolves in their own pack where they are. Another way wolves communicate is through body language. If a wolf feels confident, it will approach another wolf with its head and tail held high and ears perked up. If you saw a wolf slinking toward another with its body lowered, its tail between its legs, and its ears flattened, you\'d know it was approaching a dominant animal.</p>\\r\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\r\\n\\t<p>When a pack of wolves does howl, it can be heard from ten miles away. The howl is used as a way to call to another pack or warn of danger. Each pack has a unique howl, and while they don’t howl at the moon, wolves howl more when the moon is full and bright.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>When a wolf wants to play, it prances about happily and bows—lowering the front of its body while its rump stays up in the air with its tail wagging. When its angry, a wolf may furrow its forehead, show its fangs, or growl. A wolf\'s body language may remind you of another animal: a pet dog. Wolves and dogs are closely related, and the ways they communicate are similar.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>Young wolves stay in their parents\' pack for at least two years before some of them take off to join other packs or to start their own. They may stay close to their parents or go far away. Wolf pups play a lot as they\'re growing.

            \'safe_value\' => "<p>Wolves live in groups called packs. A pack is a family of 7-8 wolves with a mom, dad, and offspring. The wolves\' communication skills are very important to the pack\'s survival. Wolves work together to hunt, raise their young, and protect their territory. Wolves communicate with more than howls. They whimper and whine, growl and bark, yelp and snarl. They also use scents produced by their bodies to communicate. A wolf’s sense of smell is 100 times stronger than a human’s. One source of scent is urine, which they use to mark territory and to tell other wolves in their own pack where they are. Another way wolves communicate is through body language. If a wolf feels confident, it will approach another wolf with its head and tail held high and ears perked up. If you saw a wolf slinking toward another with its body lowered, its tail between its legs, and its ears flattened, you\'d know it was approaching a dominant animal.</p>\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\n<p>When a pack of wolves does howl, it can be heard from ten miles away. The howl is used as a way to call to another pack or warn of danger. Each pack has a unique howl, and while they don’t howl at the moon, wolves howl more when the moon is full and bright.</p>\\n<p>When a wolf wants to play, it prances about happily and bows—lowering the front of its body while its rump stays up in the air with its tail wagging. When its angry, a wolf may furrow its forehead, show its fangs, or growl. A wolf\'s body language may remind you of another animal: a pet dog. Wolves and dogs are closely related, and the ways they communicate are similar.</p>\\n<p>Young wolves stay in their parents\' pack for at least two years before some of them take off to join other packs or to start their own. They may stay close to their parents or go far away. Wolf pups play a lot as they\'re growing. They leap and pounce, chase and wrestle, play hide-and-seek and tag—a lot like you do!</p>\\n<p>A new wolf couple will produce one litter of pups every year.

N. tibicen becomes less common as one moves west, and it is much more common east of the Mississippi River than west.</p>\\r\\n<p>This species has been reported from the following states: Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. It can be locally abundant in preferred areas.</p>\\r\\n<p>Individuals from Florida and southern Georgia are N. tibicen australis, the southern dusky-winged cicada. There is a narrow area from southeastern Alabama where N. tibicen individuals are intergrades between this subspecies and the nominate race.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Habita</strong><br />\\r\\n\\tThis cicada most frequently inhabits deciduous forest, riparian ecosystems, shrubland, upland meadows and; to a lesser extent, eastern tall-grass prairies. Although one of the common names of this species is \\"swamp cicada\\", it is rarely associated with swampy areas. N. tibicen can also be found in tall grasses and herbaceous plants adjacent to woodlands and riparian areas. It seems to be associated with most ecosystems, and can also be abundant in urbanized and residential areas with many trees.</p>\\r\\n<p>This cicada is active from July to August across most of its distribution, however some areas may vary in emergence to decline dates based upon weather and various other environmental factors. Areas from southern Florida that rarely have frost tend to have a longer season for cicadas, which may be active from as early as June to late as January.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Life cycle</strong><br />\\r\\n\\tMales of N. tibicen call from branches of trees to females. The males prefer to sing from the tips of branches. N. tibicen prefers to call in the morning from 8 a.m. to noon, with sporadic choruses throughout the day. Males often form large, competitive singing aggregations to woo a female. The call of N. tibicen is a loud rapid chattering, starting off as a syrupy, slow whine, rising to a crescendo, and ending with a rapid chatter. The call lasts 10–15 seconds, making it shorter than the call of other species of Neotibicen cicadas. After finishing his song, the male waits a few seconds for a response from the female. She will click her wings together to respond to him. If there is no response, the male flies away to search for a new mate. After mating the female will lay her eggs in a nearby dead tree branch, using her ovipositor to slit the branch and lay her eggs. A single female may lay as many as 100 eggs, though usually it is less. The eggs will hatch within about 2 weeks, and the small, soft-bodied nymphs fall to the ground and burrow. They will go through five instars to reach adulthood. As nymphs they feed on sap that comes from the roots of trees. The nymphal stage requires about 3–5 years. When the nymphs have reached their last instar, they will emerge when the weather warms in spring and will molt for the last time. The newly emerged adult cicadas are a yellowish-white color and soft-bodied, at this stage they are said to be teneral, or have not yet developed their full color. The adults will dry overnight and fly away by dawn, to rest in a tree and continue the cycle over again. Their brown, dry skins (exuviae) are left behind on tree trunks and fences, and commonly seen by the public. Annual cicadas have generations that overlap, and individuals from the same generation may emerge in different years. Their emergence is not synchronized; therefore, they emerge annually. Periodical cicadas, also called seventeen-year cicadas, have synchronized emergences; therefore, they emerge periodically.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Diet</strong><br />\\r\\n\\tAdults of N. tibicen feed on sap from trees using their sucking, piercing mouthparts to reach the xylem of a branch. They are not host specific. As nymphs, they feed on sap from the roots of all trees.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Natural predators</strong><br />\\r\\n\\tCicadas have many predators because of their relatively few defenses. Numerous mammals, reptilians, birds, and arthropods consume cicadas.</p>\\r\\n<p>Cicada killer wasps frequently attack Neotibicen cicadas. The female wasp\'s keen eye scans trees and vegetation in search of prey. After locating a cicada, the wasp stings the cicada, injecting paralyzing venom. The wasp will then drag the paralyzed victim up a tree or post and fly away with it back to her nest. The cicada is buried in an underground burrow along with the wasp\'s eggs. The wasp\'s larvae emerge and feed on the living but paralyzed prey, pupate, and emerge the following spring. There is usually one generation of wasps a year.</p>\\r\\n<p>Certain species of flies are known to be parasitoids of adult N. tibicen, such as some Sarcophagids in the genus Emblemasoma. The female flies have enlarged hearing structures used to detect the call of male cicadas. When a cicada is located the female lands on the host and deposits living larvae. The larvae burrow quickly into the cicada, where they feed, sometimes eating the insect completely and causing it\'s death.</p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n",

The call lasts 10–15 seconds, making it shorter than the call of other species of Neotibicen cicadas. After finishing his song, the male waits a few seconds for a response from the female. She will click her wings together to respond to him. If there is no response, the male flies away to search for a new mate. After mating the female will lay her eggs in a nearby dead tree branch, using her ovipositor to slit the branch and lay her eggs. A single female may lay as many as 100 eggs, though usually it is less. The eggs will hatch within about 2 weeks, and the small, soft-bodied nymphs fall to the ground and burrow. They will go through five instars to reach adulthood. As nymphs they feed on sap that comes from the roots of trees. The nymphal stage requires about 3–5 years. When the nymphs have reached their last instar, they will emerge when the weather warms in spring and will molt for the last time. The newly emerged adult cicadas are a yellowish-white color and soft-bodied, at this stage they are said to be teneral, or have not yet developed their full color. The adults will dry overnight and fly away by dawn, to rest in a tree and continue the cycle over again. Their brown, dry skins (exuviae) are left behind on tree trunks and fences, and commonly seen by the public. Annual cicadas have generations that overlap, and individuals from the same generation may emerge in different years. Their emergence is not synchronized; therefore, they emerge annually. Periodical cicadas, also called seventeen-year cicadas, have synchronized emergences; therefore, they emerge periodically.</p>\\n<p><strong>Diet</strong><br />\\n\\tAdults of N. tibicen feed on sap from trees using their sucking, piercing mouthparts to reach the xylem of a branch. They are not host specific. As nymphs, they feed on sap from the roots of all trees.</p>\\n<p><strong>Natural predators</strong><br />\\n\\tCicadas have many predators because of their relatively few defenses. Numerous mammals, reptilians, birds, and arthropods consume cicadas.</p>\\n<p>Cicada killer wasps frequently attack Neotibicen cicadas. The female wasp\'s keen eye scans trees and vegetation in search of prey. After locating a cicada, the wasp stings the cicada, injecting paralyzing venom. The wasp will then drag the paralyzed victim up a tree or post and fly away with it back to her nest. The cicada is buried in an underground burrow along with the wasp\'s eggs. The wasp\'s larvae emerge and feed on the living but paralyzed prey, pupate, and emerge the following spring. There is usually one generation of wasps a year.</p>\\n<p>Certain species of flies are known to be parasitoids of adult N. tibicen, such as some Sarcophagids in the genus Emblemasoma. The female flies have enlarged hearing structures used to detect the call of male cicadas. When a cicada is located the female lands on the host and deposits living larvae. The larvae burrow quickly into the cicada, where they feed, sometimes eating the insect completely and causing it\'s death.</p>\\n</div>\\n",

It has a narrow base and blunt apex and usually shows 14 pronounced vertical ribs and numerous faint horizontal lines. It is attached endwise to the leaf surface.</p>\\r\\n<p>Larva<br />\\r\\n\\tThe head and body of the first-instar larva are pale yellow with fine transparent hairs arising from small white spots. The mature larva is about 3 cm long, its head and body are velvety green with short hairs. There is a faint yellow mid-dorsal line and numerous black, and occasional white, minute raised spots from which arise short translucent hairs. Segments have one or two yellow lateral spots. The larva has five pairs of prolegs.</p>\\r\\n<p>Pupa<br />\\r\\n\\tThe pupa is attached with a cremaster and girdle to some part of the food plant, or sometimes to a rock, fence or wall some distance away from the food plant. The pupa is 18-20 mm long and has a pointed anterior spine. The thorax and abdomen have a dorsal ridge with paired pointed dorsolateral ridges. When attached to the food plant the colour of the pupa is usually green, but pupae attached to other objects tend to assume the colour of the background and they are often grey or pink.</p>\\r\\n<p>Adult<br />\\r\\n\\tPieris rapae is a white, diurnally active butterfly with a wingspan of 4-6 cm. The wings are white with a black area near the tip of each forewing and a small black spot on the front edge of the wing.The female has two black spots on each forewing (Common and Waterhouse, 1981) while the male has only one. In the male, the apex and costa of the forewings are grey-black with a black spot at the lower angle of the cell and sometimes another obscure blotch below it. The hindwing has a black spot on the costa near the apex. The forewing below is white with the apex yellowish, and a pair of black blotches corresponding to the blotches on the upper surface. The hindwing is dull yellow, dusted with black. The female is slightly larger than the male, usually creamy white above and always with two black spots on the forewing (Common and Waterhouse, 1981).</p>\\r\\n<p><!--\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The small white (Pieris rapae) is a small- to medium-sized butterfly species of the whites-and-yellows family Pieridae. It is also known as the small cabbage white and in New Zealand, simply as white butterfly. The names \\"cabbage butterfly\\" and \\"cabbage white\\" can also refer to the large white. The butterfly can be distinguished by the white color with small black dots on its wings. They are distinguished from the smaller size and lack of the black band at the tip of their forewings.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">It is widespread and populations are found across Europe, North Africa, Asia, South America, and Great Britain. It has also been accidentally introduced to North America, Australia and New Zealand. The caterpillar of this species is seen as a pest for commercial agriculture. Often referred to as the \\"imported cabbageworm\\" they are a serious pest to cabbage and other mustard family crops.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Description</strong><br />\\r\\n\\tIn appearance it looks like a smaller version of the large white (Pieris brassicae). The upperside is creamy white with black tips on the forewings. Females also have two black spots in the center of the forewings. Its underwings are yellowish with black speckles. It is sometimes mistaken for a moth due to its plain appearance. The wingspan of adults is roughly 32–47 mm (1.3–1.9 in).</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong><br />\\r\\n\\tThe species has a natural range across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It was accidentally introduced to Quebec, Canada around 1860 and spread rapidly throughout North America. The species has spread to all of North American life zones from Lower Austral/Lower Sonoran to Canada. Estimates show that a single female of this species might be the progenitor in a few generations of millions. It is absent or scarce in desert and semidesert regions (except for irrigated areas). It is not found north of Canadian life zone, nor on Channel Islands off the coast of southern California. By 1898, the small white had spread to Hawaii; by 1929, it had reached New Zealand and the area around Melbourne, Australia and found its way to Perth as early as 1943.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In Britain, it has two flight periods, April–May and July–August, but is continuously-brooded in North America, being one of the first butterflies to emerge from the chrysalis in the spring and flying until hard freeze in the fall.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The species can be found in any open area with diverse plant association. It can be seen usually in towns, but also in natural habitats, mostly in valley bottoms. Although an affinity towards open areas is shown, the small white is found to have entered even small forest clearings in recent years.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The nominate subspecies P. r. rapae is found in Europe, while Asian populations are placed in the subspecies P. r. crucivora. Other subspecies include atomaria, eumorpha, leucosoma, mauretanica, napi, novangliae, and orientalis.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Life cycle</strong><br />\\r\\n\\tThe small white will readily lay eggs on both cultivated and wild members of the cabbage family, such as Charlock (Sinapis arvensis) and Hedge mustard (Sisymbrium officinale). P. rapae is known to lay eggs singularly on the host plant. The egg is characterized by a yellowish color and 12 longitudinal ridges. The egg production peaks about a week after adulthood in lab and the female can live up to 3 weeks. Females tend to lay fewer eggs on plants in clumps than on isolated plants. It has been suggested that isothiocyanate compounds in the family Brassicaceae may have been evolved to reduce herbivory by caterpillars of the small white. However, this suggestion is not generally accepted because the small white has later been shown to be immune to the isothiocyanate forming reaction due to a specific biochemical adaptation. In contrast, the small white and relatives seem to have evolved as a consequence of this biochemical adaptation to the isothiocyanate-forming glucosinolates.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Traditionally known in the United States as the imported cabbage worm, now more commonly the cabbage white, the caterpillars are bluish-green, with tiny black pints, a black ring around the spiracles, and a lateral row of yellow dashes, and a yellow middorsal line. Caterpillars rest on the undersides of the leaves, making them less visible to predators. Although the larval instars have not been fully studied, different instars are easily differentiated simply by comparing sizes, especially the head alone. During the first and second instar the head is entirely black; third instar has the clypeus yellow but the rest of the head black. In the fourth and fifth instar, there is a dark greenish-yellow dot behind each eye but with rest of the head black. However, the color of the caterpillar head does not necessarily indicate specific instar, as the time of color change is not fixed. In the larval stage, the small white can be a pest on cultivated cabbages, kale, radish, broccoli, and horseradish. The larva is considered a serious pest for commercial growth of cabbage and other Brassicaceae.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The pupa of P. rapae is very similar to that of P. napi. It is brown to mottled-gray or yellowish, matching the background color. It has a large head cone, with a vertical abdomen and flared subdorsal ridge. The two (pupa of P. rapae and P. napi) can be easily distinguished by comparing the proboscis sheath. In P. rapae, the proboscis sheath extends far beyond the antennal sheath while in P. napi, only a very short distance.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Like its close relative the large white, the small white is a strong flyer and the British population is increased by continental immigrants in most years. Adults are diurnal and fly throughout the day, except for early morning and evening. Although there is occasional activity during the later part of the night, it ceases as dawn breaks. Adult P. rapae can move many kilometers in individual flights. Adults have been observed to fly as much as 12 km in one flight. On average, a female flies about 0.7 km per day and moves 0.45 km from where she starts. Males patrol all day around host plants to mate with females.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Behavior and ecology</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t<u>Larva feeding</u><br />\\r\\n\\tThe P. rapae larva is voracious. Once it hatches from the egg, it eats its own eggshell and then moves to eat the leaves of the host plant. It bores into the interior of the cabbage, feeding on the new sprouts. The mustard oil from the hostplant makes the larva distasteful to birds. The larvae adjust their feeding rate to maintain a constant rate of nitrogen uptake. They will feed faster in low nitrogen environment and utilize the nitrogen more efficiently (at the cost of efficiency in other nutrients) than larvae hatched on nitrogen high hostplant. However, no significant difference in growth rate was observed between larvae in the two environments. Considered a serious pest, the caterpillar is known to be responsible for annual damage worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The larvae are shown to disperse their damage on the plant. Larvae are shown to feed mostly during the day. They move around the plant mostly spending their time feeding. A feeding bout is immediately followed by a change in position, either to a new leaf or to another part of the same leaf. This dispersal of damage is seen as an adaptive behavior to hide the visual cues from predators that rely on vision. Even though P. rapae larvae are cryptic, they remain in the sun for the majority of the day, rather than hiding on the underside of the leaf. The condition of the host plant influences the larval growth significantly.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Larval duration, pupal weights, adult weights, and larval growth rates were significantly altered by both plant nutrient availability and plant species. Larvae preferred Brassicaceae plants over other host plants. Larvae that have previously fed on crucifers will refuse nasturtium leaves to the point of starving to death. Within the Brassicaceae family, larvae show no significant difference in feeding behavior; larvae placed on kale show no difference from larvae placed on Brussels sprouts.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Survival rates do not differ depending on nutrition availability of host plant. Elevated plant nutrient levels decrease larval duration and increase larval growth rate. The elevated nutrition level also decreased the fourth instar’s consumption rate and increased its food utilization efficiencies. Larvae on cultivated host plant was observed to have higher growth efficiency than those fed in foliage of wild species. In short, larvae fed on high nutrition foliage show shorter duration of development, less consumption rate, higher growth rate and food processing efficiency.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Adult feeding</u><br />\\r\\n\\tAdult P. rapae use both vision and olfactory cues to identify flowers in their foraging flight. The cabbage butterfly prefers purple, blue and yellow flowers over other floral colors; visiting these flowers multiply during its life. Some flowers, like Brassica rapa, have a UV guide for aiding nectar search for the butterfly where the petals reflect near UV light whereas the center of the flower absorbs UV light, creating a visible dark center in the flower when seen in UV condition. This UV guide plays a significant role in P. rapae foraging.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The adult flies around feeding from nectars of the plant. The adult looks for certain colors among green vegetation (purple, blue, and yellow preferred to white, red and green) and extend the proboscis before landing. They probe for nectar after landing. The butterfly identifies the flower through vision and odor. Chemical compounds such as Phenylacetaldehyde or 2-Phenylethanol was shown to provoke reflex proboscis extension. The search for nectar is also limited by the memory constraint. An adult butterfly shows a flower constancy in foraging, visiting flower species that it has already experienced. The ability find nectar from the flower increased over time, showing a certain learning curve. Furthermore, the ability to find nectar from the first flower species decreased if the adult butterfly started to feed nectar from other plant species.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Courtship and reproduction</u><br />\\r\\n\\tThe male, when it spots a female, zigzags up, down, below, and in front of her, flying until she lands. The male flutters, catches her closed forewings with his legs, and spreads his wings. This causes her to lean over. He usually flies a short distance with her dangling beneath him. An unreceptive female may fly vertically or spread her wings and raise the abdomen to reject the male. Most host plants of P. rapae contain mustard oils and females use these oils to locate the plants. Females then lay the eggs singly on host leaves. In the northern hemisphere, adults appear as early as March and they continue to brood well into October. Spring adults have smaller black spots on its wings and are generally smaller than summer adults.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Host selection</u><br />\\r\\n\\tAll known host plants contain natural chemicals called glucosinolates, that are cues for egg laying. Host plants are: herb Cruciferae – Arabis glabra, Armoracia lapthifolia, Armoracia aquatica, Barbarea vulgaris, Barbarea orthoceras, Barbarea verna, Brassica oleracea, Brassica rapa, Brassica caulorapa, Brassica napus, Brassica juncea, Brassica hirta, Brassica nigra, Brassica tula, Cardaria draba, Capsella bursa-pastoris (females oviposit but larvae refuse it), Dentaria diphylla, Descurainia Sophia, Eruca sativa, Erysimum perenne, Lobularia maritime, Lunaria annua (retards larval growth), Matthiola incana, Nasturtium officinale, Raphanus sativus, Raphanus raphanistrum, Rorippa curvisiliqua, Rorippa islandica, Sisymbrium irio, Sisymbrium altissimum, Sisymbrium officinale (and var. leicocarpum), Streptanthus tortuosus, Thlaspi arvense (larvae grow slowly or refuse it); Capparidaceae: Cleome serrulata, Capparis sandwichiana; Tropaeolum: Tropaeolum majus; Resedaceae: Reseda odorata.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">There is a three phase to host selection by the P. rapae adult female butterfly: searching, landing, and contact evaluation. A gravid female adult will first locate suitable habitats, and then identify patches of vegetation that contain potential host plants. The cabbage butterflies seem to limit their search to open areas and avoid cool, shaded woodlands even when host plants are available in these areas. Furthermore, gravid females will not oviposit during overcast or rainy weather. In laboratory conditions, high light intensity is required to promote oviposition. The females fly in a linear path independent of wind direction or position of the sun.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Host plant searching behavior</u><br />\\r\\n\\tPre-mating females do not display host plant searching behavior. The behavior starts soon after mating. Flight behavior of an ovipositing female of P. rapae follows the Markov process. Females foraging for nectar will readily abandon a linear path; they will show tight turns concentrating on flower patches. Females searching for host plant, however, will follow a linear route. As a result of directionality, the number of eggs laid per plant declines with increases in host plant density. The average move length declined as host plant density increases, but the decline is not enough to concentrate eggs on a dense host plant collard. Although females avoid laying eggs on plants or leaves with other eggs or larvae in a lab condition; this discrimination is not shown in field conditions.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Adult females may search for a suitable Brassicaceae over a range of 500 m to several kilometers.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Small differences in flight patterns have been observed in Canadian and Australian P. rapae, indicating that there may be slight variation between different geographic populations.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Plant preference</u><br />\\r\\n\\tLanding appears to be mediated primarily by visual cues, of which color is the most important. P. rapae in a lab environment showed no significant preference for the shape or size of the oviposition substrate. Gravid females responded most positively to green and blue/green colors for oviposition. The preference was shown for surfaces with maximal reflectance of 550 nm. In natural conditions, oviposition was preferred on larger plants, but this was not reflected in laboratory conditions. Younger plants often had yellow/green color while older plants display a darker and stronger green. Female butterflies preferred the older plants due to the attraction to the darker green color. However, larvae perform better on younger plants.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Behavior on plant</u><br />\\r\\n\\tOnce a gravid female lands on a plant, tactile and contact chemical stimuli are major factors affecting acceptance or rejection of the site for egg deposition. Once a female lands on a host plant, it will go through a “drumming reaction” or a rapid movement of the forelegs across the surface of a leaf. This behavior is believed to provide physical and chemical information about the suitability of a plant. P. rapae is shown to prefer smooth hard surfaces similar to a surface of an index card over rougher softer textures like blotting paper or felt.

While the larvae survives from as low as 10 °C, the growth of larvae changes with changing temperature. From 10 °C to 35 °C, growth increases, but declines rapidly at temperatures higher than 35 °C. Past 40 °C, larvae start showing substantial mortality. The diurnal variation of temperature can be extensive with daily range of more than 20 °C on some sunny days and clear nights. Larvae are able to respond well to a wide range of temperature condition, which allows them to inhabit various locations in the world. In natural conditions, larvae shows fastest growth at temperatures close to 35 °C. however, in constant temperature conditions in laboratory, larvae shows mortality at 35 °C. In this lab condition, larvae grows between 10 °C to 30.5 °C while showing maximal developmental rate at 30.5 °C. The difference between lab and natural condition is due to routine temperature changes on the scale of minutes to hours under field conditions.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Predation</strong><br />\\r\\n\\tStudies in Britain showed that birds are a major predator in British town and city environments (such as in gardens) while arthropods had larger influence in rural areas. Bird predators include the house sparrow (Passer domesticus), goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis) and skylark (Alauda arvensis). Caterpillars are cryptic, coloured as green as the hostplant leaves and they rest on the undersides of the leaves, thus making them less visible to predators. Unlike the large white, they are not distasteful to predators like birds. Like many other \\"white\\" butterflies, they hibernate as a pupa. Bird predation is usually evident only in late-instar larvae or on overwintering pupae.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Parasitism</u><br />\\r\\n\\tP. rapae caterpillars are commonly parasitized by a variety of insects. The four main parasitoids are Cotesia rubecula, Cotesia glomerata, Phryxe vulgaris, and Epicampocera succinata. Cotesia rubecula and Cotesia glomerata, previously in the genus Apanteles, were introduced in North America from Asia as biocontrols. C. rubecula lays its eggs in the 1st and 2nd instar caterpillars. The larvae then grow within the caterpillar and continue to feed on the caterpillar until they are almost fully grown, and at that point the caterpillar is killed. It is important to note that only one larvae develops per host and the rate of C. rubecula is largely independent of P. rapae population size. C. glomerata is similar to C. rubecula in that both parasitize the host in either the 1st or 2nd instar. The main difference is that C. glomerata always kill the host in the 5th instar and multiple larvae can be raised within one host.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">P. rapae pupae are frequently parasitized by Pteromalus puparum.</p>\\r\\n--></p>\\r\\n<div>\\r\\n\\t<hr />\\r\\n\\t<p>Reference:<br />\\r\\n\\t\\t<a href=\\"http://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/41167\\">Invasive Species Compendium</a></p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n",

            \'safe_value\' => "<p>The egg of Pieris rapae is pale yellow and about 1 mm long. It is twice as high as it is wide, giving it a spindle shaped appearance. It has a narrow base and blunt apex and usually shows 14 pronounced vertical ribs and numerous faint horizontal lines. It is attached endwise to the leaf surface.</p>\\n<p>Larva<br />\\n\\tThe head and body of the first-instar larva are pale yellow with fine transparent hairs arising from small white spots. The mature larva is about 3 cm long, its head and body are velvety green with short hairs. There is a faint yellow mid-dorsal line and numerous black, and occasional white, minute raised spots from which arise short translucent hairs. Segments have one or two yellow lateral spots. The larva has five pairs of prolegs.</p>\\n<p>Pupa<br />\\n\\tThe pupa is attached with a cremaster and girdle to some part of the food plant, or sometimes to a rock, fence or wall some distance away from the food plant. The pupa is 18-20 mm long and has a pointed anterior spine. The thorax and abdomen have a dorsal ridge with paired pointed dorsolateral ridges. When attached to the food plant the colour of the pupa is usually green, but pupae attached to other objects tend to assume the colour of the background and they are often grey or pink.</p>\\n<p>Adult<br />\\n\\tPieris rapae is a white, diurnally active butterfly with a wingspan of 4-6 cm. The wings are white with a black area near the tip of each forewing and a small black spot on the front edge of the wing.The female has two black spots on each forewing (Common and Waterhouse, 1981) while the male has only one. In the male, the apex and costa of the forewings are grey-black with a black spot at the lower angle of the cell and sometimes another obscure blotch below it. The hindwing has a black spot on the costa near the apex. The forewing below is white with the apex yellowish, and a pair of black blotches corresponding to the blotches on the upper surface. The hindwing is dull yellow, dusted with black. The female is slightly larger than the male, usually creamy white above and always with two black spots on the forewing (Common and Waterhouse, 1981).</p>\\n<p><!--\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><p>The small white (Pieris rapae) is a small- to medium-sized butterfly species of the whites-and-yellows family Pieridae. It is also known as the small cabbage white and in New Zealand, simply as white butterfly. The names \\"cabbage butterfly\\" and \\"cabbage white\\" can also refer to the large white. The butterfly can be distinguished by the white color with small black dots on its wings. They are distinguished from the smaller size and lack of the black band at the tip of their forewings.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">It is widespread and populations are found across Europe, North Africa, Asia, South America, and Great Britain. It has also been accidentally introduced to North America, Australia and New Zealand. The caterpillar of this species is seen as a pest for commercial agriculture. Often referred to as the \\"imported cabbageworm\\" they are a serious pest to cabbage and other mustard family crops.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Description</strong><br />\\n\\tIn appearance it looks like a smaller version of the large white (Pieris brassicae). The upperside is creamy white with black tips on the forewings. Females also have two black spots in the center of the forewings. Its underwings are yellowish with black speckles. It is sometimes mistaken for a moth due to its plain appearance. The wingspan of adults is roughly 32–47 mm (1.3–1.9 in).</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong><br />\\n\\tThe species has a natural range across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It was accidentally introduced to Quebec, Canada around 1860 and spread rapidly throughout North America. The species has spread to all of North American life zones from Lower Austral/Lower Sonoran to Canada. Estimates show that a single female of this species might be the progenitor in a few generations of millions. It is absent or scarce in desert and semidesert regions (except for irrigated areas). It is not found north of Canadian life zone, nor on Channel Islands off the coast of southern California. By 1898, the small white had spread to Hawaii; by 1929, it had reached New Zealand and the area around Melbourne, Australia and found its way to Perth as early as 1943.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In Britain, it has two flight periods, April–May and July–August, but is continuously-brooded in North America, being one of the first butterflies to emerge from the chrysalis in the spring and flying until hard freeze in the fall.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The species can be found in any open area with diverse plant association. It can be seen usually in towns, but also in natural habitats, mostly in valley bottoms. Although an affinity towards open areas is shown, the small white is found to have entered even small forest clearings in recent years.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The nominate subspecies P. r. rapae is found in Europe, while Asian populations are placed in the subspecies P. r. crucivora. Other subspecies include atomaria, eumorpha, leucosoma, mauretanica, napi, novangliae, and orientalis.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Life cycle</strong><br />\\n\\tThe small white will readily lay eggs on both cultivated and wild members of the cabbage family, such as Charlock (Sinapis arvensis) and Hedge mustard (Sisymbrium officinale). P. rapae is known to lay eggs singularly on the host plant. The egg is characterized by a yellowish color and 12 longitudinal ridges. The egg production peaks about a week after adulthood in lab and the female can live up to 3 weeks. Females tend to lay fewer eggs on plants in clumps than on isolated plants. It has been suggested that isothiocyanate compounds in the family Brassicaceae may have been evolved to reduce herbivory by caterpillars of the small white. However, this suggestion is not generally accepted because the small white has later been shown to be immune to the isothiocyanate forming reaction due to a specific biochemical adaptation. In contrast, the small white and relatives seem to have evolved as a consequence of this biochemical adaptation to the isothiocyanate-forming glucosinolates.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Traditionally known in the United States as the imported cabbage worm, now more commonly the cabbage white, the caterpillars are bluish-green, with tiny black pints, a black ring around the spiracles, and a lateral row of yellow dashes, and a yellow middorsal line. Caterpillars rest on the undersides of the leaves, making them less visible to predators. Although the larval instars have not been fully studied, different instars are easily differentiated simply by comparing sizes, especially the head alone. During the first and second instar the head is entirely black; third instar has the clypeus yellow but the rest of the head black. In the fourth and fifth instar, there is a dark greenish-yellow dot behind each eye but with rest of the head black. However, the color of the caterpillar head does not necessarily indicate specific instar, as the time of color change is not fixed. In the larval stage, the small white can be a pest on cultivated cabbages, kale, radish, broccoli, and horseradish. The larva is considered a serious pest for commercial growth of cabbage and other Brassicaceae.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The pupa of P. rapae is very similar to that of P. napi. It is brown to mottled-gray or yellowish, matching the background color. It has a large head cone, with a vertical abdomen and flared subdorsal ridge. The two (pupa of P. rapae and P. napi) can be easily distinguished by comparing the proboscis sheath. In P. rapae, the proboscis sheath extends far beyond the antennal sheath while in P. napi, only a very short distance.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Like its close relative the large white, the small white is a strong flyer and the British population is increased by continental immigrants in most years. Adults are diurnal and fly throughout the day, except for early morning and evening. Although there is occasional activity during the later part of the night, it ceases as dawn breaks. Adult P. rapae can move many kilometers in individual flights. Adults have been observed to fly as much as 12 km in one flight. On average, a female flies about 0.7 km per day and moves 0.45 km from where she starts. Males patrol all day around host plants to mate with females.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Behavior and ecology</strong><br />\\n\\t<u>Larva feeding</u><br />\\n\\tThe P. rapae larva is voracious. Once it hatches from the egg, it eats its own eggshell and then moves to eat the leaves of the host plant. It bores into the interior of the cabbage, feeding on the new sprouts. The mustard oil from the hostplant makes the larva distasteful to birds. The larvae adjust their feeding rate to maintain a constant rate of nitrogen uptake. They will feed faster in low nitrogen environment and utilize the nitrogen more efficiently (at the cost of efficiency in other nutrients) than larvae hatched on nitrogen high hostplant. However, no significant difference in growth rate was observed between larvae in the two environments. Considered a serious pest, the caterpillar is known to be responsible for annual damage worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The larvae are shown to disperse their damage on the plant. Larvae are shown to feed mostly during the day. They move around the plant mostly spending their time feeding. A feeding bout is immediately followed by a change in position, either to a new leaf or to another part of the same leaf. This dispersal of damage is seen as an adaptive behavior to hide the visual cues from predators that rely on vision. Even though P. rapae larvae are cryptic, they remain in the sun for the majority of the day, rather than hiding on the underside of the leaf. The condition of the host plant influences the larval growth significantly.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Larval duration, pupal weights, adult weights, and larval growth rates were significantly altered by both plant nutrient availability and plant species. Larvae preferred Brassicaceae plants over other host plants. Larvae that have previously fed on crucifers will refuse nasturtium leaves to the point of starving to death. Within the Brassicaceae family, larvae show no significant difference in feeding behavior; larvae placed on kale show no difference from larvae placed on Brussels sprouts.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Survival rates do not differ depending on nutrition availability of host plant. Elevated plant nutrient levels decrease larval duration and increase larval growth rate. The elevated nutrition level also decreased the fourth instar’s consumption rate and increased its food utilization efficiencies. Larvae on cultivated host plant was observed to have higher growth efficiency than those fed in foliage of wild species. In short, larvae fed on high nutrition foliage show shorter duration of development, less consumption rate, higher growth rate and food processing efficiency.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Adult feeding</u><br />\\n\\tAdult P. rapae use both vision and olfactory cues to identify flowers in their foraging flight. The cabbage butterfly prefers purple, blue and yellow flowers over other floral colors; visiting these flowers multiply during its life. Some flowers, like Brassica rapa, have a UV guide for aiding nectar search for the butterfly where the petals reflect near UV light whereas the center of the flower absorbs UV light, creating a visible dark center in the flower when seen in UV condition. This UV guide plays a significant role in P. rapae foraging.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The adult flies around feeding from nectars of the plant. The adult looks for certain colors among green vegetation (purple, blue, and yellow preferred to white, red and green) and extend the proboscis before landing. They probe for nectar after landing. The butterfly identifies the flower through vision and odor. Chemical compounds such as Phenylacetaldehyde or 2-Phenylethanol was shown to provoke reflex proboscis extension. The search for nectar is also limited by the memory constraint. An adult butterfly shows a flower constancy in foraging, visiting flower species that it has already experienced. The ability find nectar from the flower increased over time, showing a certain learning curve. Furthermore, the ability to find nectar from the first flower species decreased if the adult butterfly started to feed nectar from other plant species.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Courtship and reproduction</u><br />\\n\\tThe male, when it spots a female, zigzags up, down, below, and in front of her, flying until she lands. The male flutters, catches her closed forewings with his legs, and spreads his wings. This causes her to lean over. He usually flies a short distance with her dangling beneath him. An unreceptive female may fly vertically or spread her wings and raise the abdomen to reject the male. Most host plants of P. rapae contain mustard oils and females use these oils to locate the plants. Females then lay the eggs singly on host leaves. In the northern hemisphere, adults appear as early as March and they continue to brood well into October. Spring adults have smaller black spots on its wings and are generally smaller than summer adults.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Host selection</u><br />\\n\\tAll known host plants contain natural chemicals called glucosinolates, that are cues for egg laying. Host plants are: herb Cruciferae – Arabis glabra, Armoracia lapthifolia, Armoracia aquatica, Barbarea vulgaris, Barbarea orthoceras, Barbarea verna, Brassica oleracea, Brassica rapa, Brassica caulorapa, Brassica napus, Brassica juncea, Brassica hirta, Brassica nigra, Brassica tula, Cardaria draba, Capsella bursa-pastoris (females oviposit but larvae refuse it), Dentaria diphylla, Descurainia Sophia, Eruca sativa, Erysimum perenne, Lobularia maritime, Lunaria annua (retards larval growth), Matthiola incana, Nasturtium officinale, Raphanus sativus, Raphanus raphanistrum, Rorippa curvisiliqua, Rorippa islandica, Sisymbrium irio, Sisymbrium altissimum, Sisymbrium officinale (and var. leicocarpum), Streptanthus tortuosus, Thlaspi arvense (larvae grow slowly or refuse it); Capparidaceae: Cleome serrulata, Capparis sandwichiana; Tropaeolum: Tropaeolum majus; Resedaceae: Reseda odorata.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">There is a three phase to host selection by the P. rapae adult female butterfly: searching, landing, and contact evaluation. A gravid female adult will first locate suitable habitats, and then identify patches of vegetation that contain potential host plants. The cabbage butterflies seem to limit their search to open areas and avoid cool, shaded woodlands even when host plants are available in these areas. Furthermore, gravid females will not oviposit during overcast or rainy weather. In laboratory conditions, high light intensity is required to promote oviposition. The females fly in a linear path independent of wind direction or position of the sun.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Host plant searching behavior</u><br />\\n\\tPre-mating females do not display host plant searching behavior. The behavior starts soon after mating. Flight behavior of an ovipositing female of P. rapae follows the Markov process. Females foraging for nectar will readily abandon a linear path; they will show tight turns concentrating on flower patches. Females searching for host plant, however, will follow a linear route. As a result of directionality, the number of eggs laid per plant declines with increases in host plant density. The average move length declined as host plant density increases, but the decline is not enough to concentrate eggs on a dense host plant collard. Although females avoid laying eggs on plants or leaves with other eggs or larvae in a lab condition; this discrimination is not shown in field conditions.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Adult females may search for a suitable Brassicaceae over a range of 500 m to several kilometers.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Small differences in flight patterns have been observed in Canadian and Australian P. rapae, indicating that there may be slight variation between different geographic populations.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Plant preference</u><br />\\n\\tLanding appears to be mediated primarily by visual cues, of which color is the most important.

The species is believed to have originated in Africa or Asia, from where it spread throughout Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Humans are responsible for its considerable additional range, introducing European subspecies into North America (early 1600s), South America, Australia, New Zealand, and East Asia.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Western honey bees adapted to the local environments as they spread geographically. These adaptations include synchronizing colony cycles to the timing of local flower resources, forming a winter cluster in colder climates, migratory swarming in Africa, and enhanced foraging behavior in desert areas. All together, these variations resulted in 28 recognized subspecies, all of which are cross-fertile. The subspecies are divided into four major branches, based on work by Ruttner and confirmed by mitochondrial DNA analysis. African subspecies belong to branch A, northwestern European subspecies branch M, southwestern European subspecies branch C and Middle-Eastern subspecies branch O.</p>\\r\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Unlike most other bee species, honey bees have perennial colonies which persist year after year. Because of this high degree of sociality and permanence, honey bee colonies can be considered superorganisms, meaning that reproduction of the colony, rather than individual bees, is the biologically significant unit. Honey bee colonies reproduce through a process called \\"swarming\\".</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In most climates, western honey bees swarm in the spring and early summer, when there is an abundance of blooming flowers from which to collect nectar and pollen. In response to these favorable conditions, the hive creates one to two dozen new queens. Just as the pupal stages of these \\"daughter queens\\" are nearly complete, the old queen and approximately two-thirds of the adult workers leave the colony in a swarm, traveling some distance to find a new location suitable for building a hive (e.g., a hollow tree trunk). In the old colony, the daughter queens often start \\"piping\\", just prior to emerging as adults, and, when the daughter queens eventually emerge, they fight each other until only one remains; the survivor then become the new queen. If one of the sisters emerges before the others, she may kill her siblings while they are still pupae, before they have a chance to emerge as adults.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Once she has dispatched her rivals, the new queen, the only fertile female, lays all the eggs for the old colony, which her mother has left. Virgin females are able to lay eggs, which develop into males (a trait shared with wasps, bees, and ants because of haplodiploidy). However, she requires a mate to produce female offspring, which comprise 90% or more of bees in the colony at any given time. Thus, the new queen goes on one or more nuptial flights, each time mating with 1–17 drones. Once she has finished mating, usually within two weeks of emerging, she remains in the hive, laying eggs.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Throughout the rest of the growing season, the colony produces many workers, who gather pollen and nectar to prepare for winter; the average population of a healthy hive in midsummer may be as high as 40,000 to 80,000 bees. Nectar from flowers is processed by worker bees, who evaporate it until the moisture content is low enough to discourage mold, transforming it into honey, which can then be capped over with wax and stored almost indefinitely. In the temperate climates to which western honey bees are adapted, the bees gather in their hive to wait out the winter, during which the queen may stop laying. During this time, activity is slow, and the colony consumes its stores of honey for energy to stay warm. In mid- to late winter, the queen starts laying again in preparation for spring (this is probably triggered by day length). Depending on the subspecies, new queens (and thus swarms) may be produced every year, or less frequently, depending on local environmental conditions.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Like other insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, the western honey bee has four distinct life stages: egg, larva, pupa and adult. The complex social structure of honey bee hives means that all of these life stages occur simultaneously throughout much of the year. The queen deposits a single egg into each cell prepared by worker bees. The egg hatches into a legless, eyeless larva fed by \\"nurse\\" bees (worker bees who maintain the interior of the colony). After about a week, the larva is sealed in its cell by the nurse bees and begins its pupal stage. After another week, it emerges as an adult bee. It is common for defined regions of the comb to be filled with young bees (also called \\"brood\\"), while others are filled with pollen and honey stores.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Worker bees secrete the wax used to build the hive, clean, maintain and guard it, raise the young and forage for nectar and pollen, and the nature of the worker\'s role varies with age. For the first ten days of their lives, worker bees clean the hive and feed the larvae. After this, they begin building comb cells. On days 16 through 20, workers receive nectar and pollen from older workers and store it. After the 20th day, a worker leaves the hive and spends the remainder of its life as a forager. Although worker bees are usually infertile females, when some subspecies are stressed they may lay fertile eggs. Since workers are not fully sexually developed, they do not mate with drones and thus can only produce haploid (male) offspring.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Queens and workers have a modified ovipositor, a stinger, with which they defend the hive. Unlike bees of any other genus and the queens of their own species the stinger of worker honey bees is barbed. Contrary to popular belief, a bee does not always die soon after stinging; this misconception is based on the fact that a bee will usually die after stinging a human or other mammal. The stinger and its venom sac, with musculature and a ganglion allowing them to continue delivering venom after they are detached, are designed to pull free of the body when they lodge. This apparatus (including barbs on the stinger) is thought to have evolved in response to predation by vertebrates, since the barbs do not function (and the stinger apparatus does not detach) unless the stinger is embedded in elastic material. The barbs do not always \\"catch\\", so a bee may occasionally pull its stinger free and fly off unharmed (or sting again).</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Although the average lifespan of a queen in most subspecies is three to five years, reports from the German-European black bee subspecies previously used for beekeeping indicate that a queen can live up to eight years. Because a queen\'s store of sperm is depleted near the end of her life, she begins laying more unfertilized eggs; for this reason, beekeepers often replace queens every year or two.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The lifespan of workers varies considerably over the year in regions with long winters. Workers born in spring and summer will work hard, living only a few weeks, but those born in autumn will remain inside for several months as the colony clusters. On average during the year, about one percent of a colony\'s worker bees die naturally per day. Except for the queen, all of a colony\'s workers are replaced about every four months.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Queen bee</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe queen bee is a fertile female, who, unlike workers (which are genetically also female), has a fully developed reproductive tract. She is larger than her workers, and has a characteristic rounder, longer abdomen. A female egg can become either a queen or a worker bee. Workers and queens are both fed royal jelly, which is high in protein and low in flavanoids, during the first three days of their larval stage. Workers are then switched to a diet of mixed pollen and nectar (often called \\"bee bread\\"), while queens will continue to receive royal jelly. In the absence of flavanoids and the presence of a high-protein diet, queen bees develop a healthy reproductive tract—a task necessary for maintaining a colony of tens of thousands of daughter-workers.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Periodically, the colony determines that a new queen is needed. There are three general causes:</p>\\r\\n\\t<ol>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tThe hive is filled with honey, leaving little room for new eggs. This will trigger a swarm, where the old queen will take about half the worker bees to found a new colony and leave the new queen with the other half of the workers to continue the old one.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tThe old queen begins to fail, which is thought to be demonstrated by a decrease in queen pheromones throughout the hive. This is known as supersedure, and at the end of the supersedure the old queen is generally killed.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tThe old queen dies suddenly, a situation known as emergency supersedure. The worker bees find several eggs (or larvae) of the appropriate age range and attempt to develop them into queens. Emergency supersedure can generally be recognized because new queen cells are built out from comb cells, instead of hanging from the bottom of a frame.</li>\\r\\n\\t</ol>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Regardless of the trigger, workers develop the larvae into queens by continuing to feed them royal jelly.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Queens are not raised in the typical horizontal brood cells of the honeycomb. A queen cell is larger and oriented vertically. If workers sense that an old queen is weakening, they produce emergency cells (known as supersedure cells) made from cells with eggs or young larvae and which protrude from the comb. When the queen finishes her larval feeding and pupates, she moves into a head-downward position and later chews her way out of the cell. At pupation, workers cap (seal) the cell. The queen asserts control over the worker bees by releasing a complex suite of pheromones known as queen scent.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">After several days of orientation in and around the hive, the young queen flies to a drone congregation point – a site near a clearing and generally about 30 feet (9.1 m) above the ground – where drones from different hives congregate. They detect the presence of a queen in their congregation area by her smell, find her by sight and mate with her in midair; drones can be induced to mate with \\"dummy\\" queens with the queen pheromone. A queen will mate multiple times, and may leave to mate several days in a row (weather permitting) until her spermatheca is full.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The queen lays all the eggs in a healthy colony. The number and pace of egg-laying is controlled by weather, resource availability and specific racial characteristics. Queens generally begin to slow egg-laying in the early fall, and may stop during the winter. Egg-laying generally resumes in late winter when the days lengthen, peaking in the spring. At the height of the season, the queen may lay over 2,500 eggs per day (more than her body mass).</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">She fertilizes each egg (with stored sperm from the spermatheca) as it is laid in a worker-sized cell. Eggs laid in drone-sized (larger) cells are left unfertilized; these unfertilized eggs, with half as many genes as queen or worker eggs, develop into drones.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Workers</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tWorkers are sterile females produced by the queen that develop from fertilized, diploid eggs. Workers are essential for social structure and proper colony functioning. They carry out the main tasks of the colony, because the queen is occupied with only reproducing. These females will raise their sister workers and future queens that eventually leave the nest to start their own colony. They also forage and return to the nest with nectar and pollen to feed the young.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Drones</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tDrones are the colony\'s male bees. Since they do not have ovipositors, they do not have stingers. Drone honey bees do not forage for nectar or pollen. The primary purpose of a drone is to fertilize a new queen. Many drones will mate with a given queen in flight; each will die immediately after mating, since the process of insemination requires a lethally convulsive effort. Drone honey bees are haploid (single, unpaired chromosomes) in their genetic structure, and are descended only from their mother (the queen). In temperate regions drones are generally expelled from the hive before winter, dying of cold and starvation since they cannot forage, produce honey or care for themselves. There has been research into the role A. mellifera drones play in thermoregulation within the hive. Given their larger size (1.5x), drones may play a significant role. Drones are typically located near the center of hive clusters for unclear reasons. It is postulated that it is to maintain sperm viability, which drops off at cooler temperatures. Another possible explanation is that a more central location allows drones to contribute to warmth, since at temperatures below 25 °C their ability to contribute declines.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Worker policing</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tWhen a fertile female worker produces drones, a conflict arises between her interests and those of the queen. The worker shares half her genes with the drone and one-quarter with her brothers, favouring her offspring over those of the queen. The queen shares half her genes with her sons and one-quarter with the sons of fertile female workers. This pits the worker against the queen and other workers, who try to maximize their reproductive fitness by rearing the offspring most related to them. This relationship leads to a phenomenon known as \\"worker policing\\". In these rare situations, other worker bees in the hive who are genetically more related to the queen\'s sons than those of the fertile workers will patrol the hive and remove worker-laid eggs. Another form of worker-based policing is aggression toward fertile females. Some studies have suggested a queen pheromone which may help workers distinguish worker- and queen-laid eggs, but others indicate egg viability as the key factor in eliciting the behavior. Worker policing is an example of forced altruism, where the benefits of worker reproduction are minimized and that of rearing the queen\'s offspring maximized.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In very rare instances workers subvert the policing mechanisms of the hive, laying eggs which are removed at a lower rate by other workers; this is known as anarchic syndrome. Anarchic workers can activate their ovaries at a higher rate and contribute a greater proportion of males to the hive. Although an increase in the number of drones would decrease the overall productivity of the hive, the reproductive fitness of the drones\' mother would increase. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at the individual and group levels for the stability of the hive.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Under ordinary circumstances the death (or removal) of a queen increases reproduction in workers, and a significant proportion of workers will have active ovaries in the absence of a queen. The workers of the hive produce a last batch of drones before the hive eventually collapses. Although during this period worker policing is usually absent, in certain groups of bees it continues.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">According to the strategy of kin selection, worker policing is not favored if a queen does not mate multiple times. Workers would be related by three-quarters of their genes, and the difference in relationship between sons of the queen and those of the other workers would decrease. The benefit of policing is negated, and policing is less favored. Experiments confirming this hypothesis have shown a correlation between higher mating rates and increased rates of worker policing in many species of social hymenoptera.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Behavior<br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThermoregulation</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe honey bee needs an internal body temperature of 35 °C (95 °F) to fly; this temperature is maintained in the nest to develop the brood, and is the optimal temperature for the creation of wax. The temperature on the periphery of the cluster varies with outside air temperature, and the winter cluster\'s internal temperature may be as low as 20–22 °C (68–72 °F).</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Honey bees can forage over a 30 °C (86 °F) air-temperature range because of behavioral and physiological mechanisms for regulating the temperature of their flight muscles. From low to high air temperatures, the mechanisms are: shivering before flight, and stopping flight for additional shivering; passive body-temperature regulation based on work, and evaporative cooling from regurgitated honey-sac contents. Body temperatures differ, depending on caste and expected foraging rewards.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The optimal air temperature for foraging is 22–25 °C (72–77 °F). During flight, the bee\'s relatively large flight muscles create heat which must dissipate. The honey bee uses evaporative cooling to release heat through its mouth. Under hot conditions, heat from the thorax is dissipated through the head; the bee regurgitates a droplet of warm internal fluid — a \\"honeycrop droplet\\" – which reduces the temperature of its head by 10 °C (18 °F).</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Below 7–10 °C (45–50 °F) bees are immobile, and above 38 °C (100 °F) their activity slows. Honey bees can tolerate temperatures up to 50 °C (122 °F) for short periods.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Communication</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tHoney-bee behavior has been extensively studied, since bees are widespread and familiar. Karl von Frisch, who received the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his study of honey-bee communication, noticed that bees communicate with dance. Through these dances, bees communicate information regarding the distance, the situation, and the direction of a food source by the dances of the returning (honey bee) worker bee on the vertical comb of the hive. Honey bees direct other bees to food sources with the round dance and the waggle dance. Although the round dance tells other foragers that food is within 50 metres (160 ft) of the hive, it provides insufficient information about direction. The waggle dance, which may be vertical or horizontal, provides more detail about the distance and direction of a food source. Foragers are also thought to rely on their olfactory sense to help locate a food source after they are directed by the dances. Unlike A. mellifera, Apis florea do not change the precision of the waggle dance to indicate the type of site that is set as a new goal. Therefore, Apis mellifera bees are better at conveying information than its closely related species and this further supports the notion that A. mellifera honeybees are more evolved than Apis florea.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Another means of communication is the shaking signal, also known as the jerking dance, vibration dance or vibration signal. Although the shaking signal is most common in worker communication, it also appears in reproductive swarming. A worker bee vibrates its body dorsoventrally while holding another bee with its front legs. Jacobus Biesmeijer, who examined shaking signals in a forager\'s life and the conditions leading to its performance, found that experienced foragers executed 92.1 percent of observed shaking signals and 64 percent of these signals were made after the discovery of a food source. About 71 percent of shaking signals occurred before the first five successful foraging flights of the day; other communication signals, such as the waggle dance, were performed more often after the first five successes. Biesmeijer demonstrated that most shakers are foragers and the shaking signal is most often executed by foraging bees on pre-foraging bees, concluding that it is a transfer message for several activities (or activity levels). Sometimes the signal increases activity, as when active bees shake inactive ones. At other times, such as the end of the day, the signal is an inhibitory mechanism. However, the shaking signal is preferentially directed towards inactive bees. All three forms of communication among honey bees are effective in foraging and task management.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Pheromones</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tPheromones (substances involved in chemical communication) are essential to honey-bee survival. Honey bees rely on pheromones for nearly all behaviors, including mating, alarm, defense, orientation, kin and colony recognition, food production and integrating colony activities.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Domestication</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe honey bee is one of the few invertebrate animals to have been domesticated. Wild honey was collected by man in the Palaeolithic or Mesolithic periods, with evidence from rock art from France and Spain around 8,000 years old. Bees were likely first domesticated in ancient Egypt, where beekeeping is depicted in tomb paintings. Bees were brought to North America in 1622.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Beekeepers have selected bees for several desirable features:</p>\\r\\n\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tthe ability of a colony to survive periods with little food;</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tthe ability of a colony to survive cold weather;</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tresistance to disease;</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tincreased honey production;</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\treduced aggressiveness;</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\treduced tendency to swarm;</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\treduced nest building;</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\teasy pacification with smoke.</li>\\r\\n\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">These modifications, along with artificial change of location, have improved bees from the point of view of the beekeeper, and simultaneously made them more dependent on beekeepers for their survival. In Europe, cold weather survival was likely selected for, consciously or not, while in Africa, selection probably favoured the ability to survive heat, drought, and heavy rain.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Authors do not agree on whether this degree of artificial selection constitutes genuine domestication. In 1603, John Guillim wrote \\"The Bee I may well reckon a domestik Insect, being so pliable to the Benefit of the Keeper\\". More recently, many biologists working on pollination take the domesticated status of honey bees for granted. For example, Rachael Winfree and colleagues write \\"We used crop pollination as a model system, and investigated whether the loss of a domesticated pollinator (the honey bee) could be compensated for by native, wild bee species.\\" Similarly, Brian Dennis and William Kemp write that \\"Although the domestication of the honey bee is closely connected to the evolution of food-based socio-economic systems in many cultures throughout the world, in current economic terms, and in the U.S. alone, the estimated wholesale value of honey, more than $317 million dollars in 2013, pales in comparison to aggregate estimated annual value of pollination services, variously valued at $11–15 billion.\\"</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">On the other hand, P. R. Oxley and B. P. Oldroyd (2010) consider the domestication at best partial. Oldroyd observes that the lack of full domestication is somewhat surprising, given that people have kept bees for at least 7000 years. Instead, beekeepers have found ways to manage bees using hives, while the bees remain \\"largely unchanged from their wild cousins\\". Leslie Bailey and B. V. Ball, in their book Honey Bee Pathology, call honey bees \\"feral insects\\", in contrast to the silkworm (Bombyx mori) which they call \\"the only insect that has been domesticated\\", and refer to the \\"popular belief among many biologists as well as beekeepers that bees are domesticated\\". They argue that honey bees are able to survive without man\'s help, and in fact require to \\"be left at liberty\\" to survive. They argue further that even if bees could be raised away from the wild, they would still have to fly freely to gather nectar and pollinate plants. Therefore, they argue, beekeeping is \\"the exploitation of colonies of a wild insect\\", with little more than the provision of a weatherproof cavity for them to nest in. Pilar de la Rua and colleagues likewise argue that honey bees are not fully domesticated, since \\"endemic subspecies-specific genetic footprints can still be identified in Europe and Africa\\", making conservation of wild bee diversity important. They further argue that the difficulty of controlling drones for mating is a serious handicap and a sign that domestication is not complete, in particular as \\"extensive gene flow usually occurs between wild/feral and managed honeybee populations\\".</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Beekeeping</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe honey bee is a colonial insect which is housed, fed and transported by beekeepers. Honey bees do not survive and reproduce individually, but as part of the colony (also known as a superorganism).</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Honey bees collect flower nectar and convert it to honey, which is stored in the hive. The nectar, transported in the bees\' stomachs, is converted with the addition of digestive enzymes and storage in a honey cell for partial dehydration. Nectar and honey provide the energy for the bees\' flight muscles and for heating the hive during the winter. Honey bees also collect pollen, which supplies protein and fat for the bee brood to grow. Centuries of selective breeding by humans have created bees which produce far more honey than the colony needs, and beekeepers (also known as apiarists) harvest the surplus honey.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Beekeepers provide a place for the colony to live and store honey. There are seven basic types of beehive: skeps, Langstroth hives, top-bar hives, box hives, log gums, D. E. hive, and miller hives. All U.S. states require beekeepers to use movable frames to allow bee inspectors to check the brood for disease. This allows beekeepers to keep Langstroth, top-bar and D.E. hives without special permission, granted for purposes such as museum use. Modern hives also enable beekeepers to transport bees, moving from field to field as crops require pollinating (a source of income for beekeepers).</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In cold climates, some beekeepers have kept colonies alive (with varying degrees of success) by moving them indoors for winter. While this can protect the colonies from extremes of temperature and make winter care and feeding more convenient for the beekeeper, it increases the risk of dysentery and causes an excessive buildup of carbon dioxide from the bees\' respiration. Inside wintering has been refined by Canadian beekeepers, who use large barns solely for the wintering of bees; automated ventilation systems assist in carbon-dioxide dispersal.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Products</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tA primary product of honey bees is more honey bees. Honey bees are bought as mated queens, in spring packages of a queen with 2 to 5 pounds (0.91 to 2.27 kg) of bees, as nucleus colonies (which include frames of brood) and as full colonies. Commerce in bees dates to prehistory, and modern methods of producing queens and dividing colonies for increase date to the late 1800s. Bees are typically produced in temperate to tropical regions and sold to colder areas; packages of bees produced in Florida are sold to beekeepers in Michigan.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Pollination</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe honey bee\'s primary commercial value is as a pollinator of crops. Although orchards and fields have increased in size, wild pollinators have dwindled. In a number of regions the pollination shortage is addressed by migratory beekeepers, who supply hives during a crop bloom and move them after the blooming period. Commercial beekeepers plan their movements and wintering locations according to anticipated pollination services. At higher latitudes it is difficult (or impossible) to winter over sufficient bees, or to have them ready for early blooming plants. Much migration is seasonal, with hives wintering in warmer climates and moving to follow the bloom at higher latitudes. In California almond pollination occurs in February, early in the growing season before local hives have built up their populations.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Almond orchards require two hives per acre (2,000 m² per hive) for maximum yield, and pollination is dependent on the importation of hives from warmer climates. Almond pollination (in February and March in the United States) is the largest managed pollination event in the world, requiring more than one-third of all managed honey bees in the country. Mass movements of bees are also made for apples in New York, Michigan, and Washington. Despite honey bees\' inefficiency as blueberry pollinators, large numbers are moved to Maine because they are the only pollinators who can be easily moved and concentrated for this and other monoculture crops. Bees and other insects maintain flower constancy by transferring pollen to other biologically specific plants; this prevents flower stigmas from being clogged with pollen from other species.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Honey</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tHoney is the complex substance made from nectar and sweet deposits from plants and trees which are gathered, modified and stored in the comb by honey bees. Honey is a biological mixture of inverted sugars, primarily glucose and fructose. It has antibacterial and anti fungal properties. Honey from the Western honey bee, along with the bee Tetragonisca angustula, has specific antibacterial activity towards an infection causing bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus. Honey will not rot or ferment when stored under normal conditions, however it will crystallize over time. Although crystallized honey is acceptable for human use, bees can only use liquid honey and will remove and discard crystallized honey from the hive.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Bees produce honey by collecting nectar, a clear liquid consisting of nearly 80 percent water and complex sugars. The collecting bees store the nectar in a second stomach and return to the hive, where worker bees remove the nectar. The worker bees digest the raw nectar for about 30 minutes, using enzymes to break down the complex sugars into simpler ones. Raw honey is then spread in empty honeycomb cells to dry, reducing its water content to less than 20 percent. When nectar is being processed, honey bees create a draft through the hive by fanning with their wings. When the honey has dried, the honeycomb cells are sealed (capped) with wax to preserve it.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">When a hive detects smoke, many bees become nonaggressive; this is thought to be a defense mechanism. Wild colonies generally live in hollow trees; when they detect smoke, they are thought to prepare to evacuate from a forest fire with as much food as they can. To do this, they go to the nearest honey-storage cells and gorge on honey. In this state they are docile, since defending against predation is less important than saving as much food as possible.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Beeswax</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tMature worker bees secrete beeswax from glands on their abdomen, using it to form the walls and caps of the comb. When honey is harvested, the wax can be collected for use in products like candles and seals.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Pollen</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tBees collect pollen in a pollen basket and carry it back to the hive, where it is a protein source for brood-rearing. Excess pollen can be collected from the hive; although it is sometimes consumed as a dietary supplement by humans, bee pollen may cause an allergic reaction in susceptible individuals.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Propolis</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tPropolis is a resinous mixture collected by honey bees from tree buds, sap flows or other botanical sources, which is used as a sealant for unwanted open spaces in the hive. Although propolis is alleged to have health benefits (tincture of Propolis is marketed as a cold and flu remedy), it may cause severe allergic reactions in some individuals. Propolis is also used in wood finishes, and gives a Stradivarius violin its unique red color.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Royal jelly</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tRoyal jelly is a honey-bee secretion used to nourish the larvae. It is marketed for its alleged health benefits. On the other hand, it may cause severe allergic reactions in some individuals.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Genome</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tAs of October 28, 2006, the Honey Bee Genome Sequencing Consortium fully sequenced and analyzed the genome of Apis mellifera. Since 2007, attention has been devoted to colony collapse disorder, a decline in European honey bee colonies in a number of regions.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The European honey bee is the third insect, after the fruit fly and the mosquito, to have its genome mapped. According to scientists who analyzed its genetic code, the honey bee originated in Africa and spread to Europe in two ancient migrations. Scientists have found that genes related to smell outnumber those for taste, and the European honey bee has fewer genes regulating immunity than the fruit fly and the mosquito. The genome sequence also revealed that several groups of genes, particularly those related to circadian rhythm, resembled those of vertebrates more than other insects. Another significant finding from the honey bee genome study was that honey bee was the first insect to be discovered with a functional DNA methylation system because functional key enzymes (DNA methyl-transferase 1 and 3) were identified in the genome. DNA methylation is one of the important mechanisms in epigenetics to study gene expression and regulation without changing the DNA sequence, but modifications on the DNA. DNA methylation later was identified to play an important role in gene regulation and gene alternative splicing. The genome is unusual in having few transposable elements, although they were present in the evolutionary past (inactive remains have been found) and evolved more slowly than those in fly species.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Hazards and survival</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tEuropean honey-bee populations face threats to their survival, increasing interests in other pollinator species like B. impatiens. North American and European populations were severely depleted by varroa-mite infestations during the early 1990s, and US beekeepers were further affected by colony collapse disorder in 2006 and 2007. Improved cultural practices and chemical treatments against varroa mites saved most commercial operations; new bee breeds are beginning to reduce beekeeper dependence on acaricides. Feral bee populations were greatly reduced during this period; they are slowly recovering, primarily in mild climates, due to natural selection for varroa resistance and repopulation by resistant breeds. Insecticides, particularly when used in excess of label directions, have also depleted bee populations as bee pests and diseases (including American foulbrood and tracheal mites) are becoming resistant to medications.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Environmental hazards</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tAfricanized bees have spread across the southern United States, where they pose a slight danger to humans (making beekeeping—particularly hobby beekeeping—difficult). As an invasive species, feral honey bees have become a significant environmental problem in non-native areas. Imported bees may displace native bees and birds, and may also promote the reproduction of invasive plants ignored by native pollinators. Unlike native bees, they do not properly extract or transfer pollen from plants with pore anthers (anthers which only release pollen through tiny apical pores); this requires buzz pollination, a behavior rarely exhibited by honey bees. Honey bees reduce fruiting in Melastoma affine, a plant with pore anthers, by robbing its stigmas of previously deposited pollen.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Predators</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tInsect predators of honeybees include the Asian giant hornet and other wasps, robber flies, dragonflies such as the green darner, the European beewolf, some Praying mantises, and the water strider.</p>\\r\\n\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tArachnid predators of honeybees include fishing spiders, lynx spiders, goldenrod spiders and the St Andrew\'s Cross spider.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tReptile and amphibian predators of honeybees include the American toad, Anole lizards, the American bullfrog and the wood Frog.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tSpecialist bird predators include the bee-eaters; other birds that may take bees include grackles, hummingbirds, and tyrant flycatchers.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tMammals that sometimes take bees include bears, least shrews, opossums, raccoons, honey badgers and skunks.</li>\\r\\n\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Close Relatives<br />\\r\\n\\t\\tApart from Apis mellifera, there are 6 other species in the genus Apis.

The species is believed to have originated in Africa or Asia, from where it spread throughout Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Humans are responsible for its considerable additional range, introducing European subspecies into North America (early 1600s), South America, Australia, New Zealand, and East Asia.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Western honey bees adapted to the local environments as they spread geographically. These adaptations include synchronizing colony cycles to the timing of local flower resources, forming a winter cluster in colder climates, migratory swarming in Africa, and enhanced foraging behavior in desert areas. All together, these variations resulted in 28 recognized subspecies, all of which are cross-fertile. The subspecies are divided into four major branches, based on work by Ruttner and confirmed by mitochondrial DNA analysis. African subspecies belong to branch A, northwestern European subspecies branch M, southwestern European subspecies branch C and Middle-Eastern subspecies branch O.</p>\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Unlike most other bee species, honey bees have perennial colonies which persist year after year. Because of this high degree of sociality and permanence, honey bee colonies can be considered superorganisms, meaning that reproduction of the colony, rather than individual bees, is the biologically significant unit. Honey bee colonies reproduce through a process called \\"swarming\\".</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In most climates, western honey bees swarm in the spring and early summer, when there is an abundance of blooming flowers from which to collect nectar and pollen. In response to these favorable conditions, the hive creates one to two dozen new queens. Just as the pupal stages of these \\"daughter queens\\" are nearly complete, the old queen and approximately two-thirds of the adult workers leave the colony in a swarm, traveling some distance to find a new location suitable for building a hive (e.g., a hollow tree trunk). In the old colony, the daughter queens often start \\"piping\\", just prior to emerging as adults, and, when the daughter queens eventually emerge, they fight each other until only one remains; the survivor then become the new queen. If one of the sisters emerges before the others, she may kill her siblings while they are still pupae, before they have a chance to emerge as adults.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Once she has dispatched her rivals, the new queen, the only fertile female, lays all the eggs for the old colony, which her mother has left. Virgin females are able to lay eggs, which develop into males (a trait shared with wasps, bees, and ants because of haplodiploidy). However, she requires a mate to produce female offspring, which comprise 90% or more of bees in the colony at any given time. Thus, the new queen goes on one or more nuptial flights, each time mating with 1–17 drones. Once she has finished mating, usually within two weeks of emerging, she remains in the hive, laying eggs.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Throughout the rest of the growing season, the colony produces many workers, who gather pollen and nectar to prepare for winter; the average population of a healthy hive in midsummer may be as high as 40,000 to 80,000 bees. Nectar from flowers is processed by worker bees, who evaporate it until the moisture content is low enough to discourage mold, transforming it into honey, which can then be capped over with wax and stored almost indefinitely. In the temperate climates to which western honey bees are adapted, the bees gather in their hive to wait out the winter, during which the queen may stop laying. During this time, activity is slow, and the colony consumes its stores of honey for energy to stay warm. In mid- to late winter, the queen starts laying again in preparation for spring (this is probably triggered by day length). Depending on the subspecies, new queens (and thus swarms) may be produced every year, or less frequently, depending on local environmental conditions.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Like other insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, the western honey bee has four distinct life stages: egg, larva, pupa and adult. The complex social structure of honey bee hives means that all of these life stages occur simultaneously throughout much of the year. The queen deposits a single egg into each cell prepared by worker bees. The egg hatches into a legless, eyeless larva fed by \\"nurse\\" bees (worker bees who maintain the interior of the colony). After about a week, the larva is sealed in its cell by the nurse bees and begins its pupal stage. After another week, it emerges as an adult bee. It is common for defined regions of the comb to be filled with young bees (also called \\"brood\\"), while others are filled with pollen and honey stores.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Worker bees secrete the wax used to build the hive, clean, maintain and guard it, raise the young and forage for nectar and pollen, and the nature of the worker\'s role varies with age. For the first ten days of their lives, worker bees clean the hive and feed the larvae. After this, they begin building comb cells. On days 16 through 20, workers receive nectar and pollen from older workers and store it. After the 20th day, a worker leaves the hive and spends the remainder of its life as a forager. Although worker bees are usually infertile females, when some subspecies are stressed they may lay fertile eggs. Since workers are not fully sexually developed, they do not mate with drones and thus can only produce haploid (male) offspring.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Queens and workers have a modified ovipositor, a stinger, with which they defend the hive. Unlike bees of any other genus and the queens of their own species the stinger of worker honey bees is barbed. Contrary to popular belief, a bee does not always die soon after stinging; this misconception is based on the fact that a bee will usually die after stinging a human or other mammal. The stinger and its venom sac, with musculature and a ganglion allowing them to continue delivering venom after they are detached, are designed to pull free of the body when they lodge. This apparatus (including barbs on the stinger) is thought to have evolved in response to predation by vertebrates, since the barbs do not function (and the stinger apparatus does not detach) unless the stinger is embedded in elastic material. The barbs do not always \\"catch\\", so a bee may occasionally pull its stinger free and fly off unharmed (or sting again).</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Although the average lifespan of a queen in most subspecies is three to five years, reports from the German-European black bee subspecies previously used for beekeeping indicate that a queen can live up to eight years. Because a queen\'s store of sperm is depleted near the end of her life, she begins laying more unfertilized eggs; for this reason, beekeepers often replace queens every year or two.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The lifespan of workers varies considerably over the year in regions with long winters. Workers born in spring and summer will work hard, living only a few weeks, but those born in autumn will remain inside for several months as the colony clusters. On average during the year, about one percent of a colony\'s worker bees die naturally per day. Except for the queen, all of a colony\'s workers are replaced about every four months.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Queen bee</u><br />\\n\\t\\tThe queen bee is a fertile female, who, unlike workers (which are genetically also female), has a fully developed reproductive tract. She is larger than her workers, and has a characteristic rounder, longer abdomen. A female egg can become either a queen or a worker bee. Workers and queens are both fed royal jelly, which is high in protein and low in flavanoids, during the first three days of their larval stage. Workers are then switched to a diet of mixed pollen and nectar (often called \\"bee bread\\"), while queens will continue to receive royal jelly. In the absence of flavanoids and the presence of a high-protein diet, queen bees develop a healthy reproductive tract—a task necessary for maintaining a colony of tens of thousands of daughter-workers.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Periodically, the colony determines that a new queen is needed. There are three general causes:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tThe hive is filled with honey, leaving little room for new eggs. This will trigger a swarm, where the old queen will take about half the worker bees to found a new colony and leave the new queen with the other half of the workers to continue the old one.</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tThe old queen begins to fail, which is thought to be demonstrated by a decrease in queen pheromones throughout the hive. This is known as supersedure, and at the end of the supersedure the old queen is generally killed.</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tThe old queen dies suddenly, a situation known as emergency supersedure. The worker bees find several eggs (or larvae) of the appropriate age range and attempt to develop them into queens. Emergency supersedure can generally be recognized because new queen cells are built out from comb cells, instead of hanging from the bottom of a frame.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Regardless of the trigger, workers develop the larvae into queens by continuing to feed them royal jelly.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Queens are not raised in the typical horizontal brood cells of the honeycomb. A queen cell is larger and oriented vertically. If workers sense that an old queen is weakening, they produce emergency cells (known as supersedure cells) made from cells with eggs or young larvae and which protrude from the comb. When the queen finishes her larval feeding and pupates, she moves into a head-downward position and later chews her way out of the cell. At pupation, workers cap (seal) the cell. The queen asserts control over the worker bees by releasing a complex suite of pheromones known as queen scent.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">After several days of orientation in and around the hive, the young queen flies to a drone congregation point – a site near a clearing and generally about 30 feet (9.1 m) above the ground – where drones from different hives congregate. They detect the presence of a queen in their congregation area by her smell, find her by sight and mate with her in midair; drones can be induced to mate with \\"dummy\\" queens with the queen pheromone. A queen will mate multiple times, and may leave to mate several days in a row (weather permitting) until her spermatheca is full.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The queen lays all the eggs in a healthy colony. The number and pace of egg-laying is controlled by weather, resource availability and specific racial characteristics. Queens generally begin to slow egg-laying in the early fall, and may stop during the winter. Egg-laying generally resumes in late winter when the days lengthen, peaking in the spring. At the height of the season, the queen may lay over 2,500 eggs per day (more than her body mass).</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">She fertilizes each egg (with stored sperm from the spermatheca) as it is laid in a worker-sized cell. Eggs laid in drone-sized (larger) cells are left unfertilized; these unfertilized eggs, with half as many genes as queen or worker eggs, develop into drones.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Workers</u><br />\\n\\t\\tWorkers are sterile females produced by the queen that develop from fertilized, diploid eggs. Workers are essential for social structure and proper colony functioning. They carry out the main tasks of the colony, because the queen is occupied with only reproducing. These females will raise their sister workers and future queens that eventually leave the nest to start their own colony. They also forage and return to the nest with nectar and pollen to feed the young.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Drones</u><br />\\n\\t\\tDrones are the colony\'s male bees. Since they do not have ovipositors, they do not have stingers. Drone honey bees do not forage for nectar or pollen. The primary purpose of a drone is to fertilize a new queen. Many drones will mate with a given queen in flight; each will die immediately after mating, since the process of insemination requires a lethally convulsive effort. Drone honey bees are haploid (single, unpaired chromosomes) in their genetic structure, and are descended only from their mother (the queen). In temperate regions drones are generally expelled from the hive before winter, dying of cold and starvation since they cannot forage, produce honey or care for themselves. There has been research into the role A. mellifera drones play in thermoregulation within the hive. Given their larger size (1.5x), drones may play a significant role. Drones are typically located near the center of hive clusters for unclear reasons. It is postulated that it is to maintain sperm viability, which drops off at cooler temperatures. Another possible explanation is that a more central location allows drones to contribute to warmth, since at temperatures below 25 °C their ability to contribute declines.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Worker policing</u><br />\\n\\t\\tWhen a fertile female worker produces drones, a conflict arises between her interests and those of the queen. The worker shares half her genes with the drone and one-quarter with her brothers, favouring her offspring over those of the queen. The queen shares half her genes with her sons and one-quarter with the sons of fertile female workers. This pits the worker against the queen and other workers, who try to maximize their reproductive fitness by rearing the offspring most related to them. This relationship leads to a phenomenon known as \\"worker policing\\". In these rare situations, other worker bees in the hive who are genetically more related to the queen\'s sons than those of the fertile workers will patrol the hive and remove worker-laid eggs. Another form of worker-based policing is aggression toward fertile females. Some studies have suggested a queen pheromone which may help workers distinguish worker- and queen-laid eggs, but others indicate egg viability as the key factor in eliciting the behavior. Worker policing is an example of forced altruism, where the benefits of worker reproduction are minimized and that of rearing the queen\'s offspring maximized.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In very rare instances workers subvert the policing mechanisms of the hive, laying eggs which are removed at a lower rate by other workers; this is known as anarchic syndrome. Anarchic workers can activate their ovaries at a higher rate and contribute a greater proportion of males to the hive. Although an increase in the number of drones would decrease the overall productivity of the hive, the reproductive fitness of the drones\' mother would increase. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at the individual and group levels for the stability of the hive.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Under ordinary circumstances the death (or removal) of a queen increases reproduction in workers, and a significant proportion of workers will have active ovaries in the absence of a queen. The workers of the hive produce a last batch of drones before the hive eventually collapses. Although during this period worker policing is usually absent, in certain groups of bees it continues.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">According to the strategy of kin selection, worker policing is not favored if a queen does not mate multiple times. Workers would be related by three-quarters of their genes, and the difference in relationship between sons of the queen and those of the other workers would decrease. The benefit of policing is negated, and policing is less favored. Experiments confirming this hypothesis have shown a correlation between higher mating rates and increased rates of worker policing in many species of social hymenoptera.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Behavior<br />\\n\\t\\tThermoregulation</u><br />\\n\\t\\tThe honey bee needs an internal body temperature of 35 °C (95 °F) to fly; this temperature is maintained in the nest to develop the brood, and is the optimal temperature for the creation of wax. The temperature on the periphery of the cluster varies with outside air temperature, and the winter cluster\'s internal temperature may be as low as 20–22 °C (68–72 °F).</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Honey bees can forage over a 30 °C (86 °F) air-temperature range because of behavioral and physiological mechanisms for regulating the temperature of their flight muscles. From low to high air temperatures, the mechanisms are: shivering before flight, and stopping flight for additional shivering; passive body-temperature regulation based on work, and evaporative cooling from regurgitated honey-sac contents. Body temperatures differ, depending on caste and expected foraging rewards.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The optimal air temperature for foraging is 22–25 °C (72–77 °F). During flight, the bee\'s relatively large flight muscles create heat which must dissipate. The honey bee uses evaporative cooling to release heat through its mouth. Under hot conditions, heat from the thorax is dissipated through the head; the bee regurgitates a droplet of warm internal fluid — a \\"honeycrop droplet\\" – which reduces the temperature of its head by 10 °C (18 °F).</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Below 7–10 °C (45–50 °F) bees are immobile, and above 38 °C (100 °F) their activity slows. Honey bees can tolerate temperatures up to 50 °C (122 °F) for short periods.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Communication</u><br />\\n\\t\\tHoney-bee behavior has been extensively studied, since bees are widespread and familiar. Karl von Frisch, who received the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his study of honey-bee communication, noticed that bees communicate with dance. Through these dances, bees communicate information regarding the distance, the situation, and the direction of a food source by the dances of the returning (honey bee) worker bee on the vertical comb of the hive. Honey bees direct other bees to food sources with the round dance and the waggle dance. Although the round dance tells other foragers that food is within 50 metres (160 ft) of the hive, it provides insufficient information about direction. The waggle dance, which may be vertical or horizontal, provides more detail about the distance and direction of a food source. Foragers are also thought to rely on their olfactory sense to help locate a food source after they are directed by the dances. Unlike A. mellifera, Apis florea do not change the precision of the waggle dance to indicate the type of site that is set as a new goal. Therefore, Apis mellifera bees are better at conveying information than its closely related species and this further supports the notion that A. mellifera honeybees are more evolved than Apis florea.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Another means of communication is the shaking signal, also known as the jerking dance, vibration dance or vibration signal. Although the shaking signal is most common in worker communication, it also appears in reproductive swarming. A worker bee vibrates its body dorsoventrally while holding another bee with its front legs. Jacobus Biesmeijer, who examined shaking signals in a forager\'s life and the conditions leading to its performance, found that experienced foragers executed 92.1 percent of observed shaking signals and 64 percent of these signals were made after the discovery of a food source. About 71 percent of shaking signals occurred before the first five successful foraging flights of the day; other communication signals, such as the waggle dance, were performed more often after the first five successes. Biesmeijer demonstrated that most shakers are foragers and the shaking signal is most often executed by foraging bees on pre-foraging bees, concluding that it is a transfer message for several activities (or activity levels). Sometimes the signal increases activity, as when active bees shake inactive ones. At other times, such as the end of the day, the signal is an inhibitory mechanism. However, the shaking signal is preferentially directed towards inactive bees. All three forms of communication among honey bees are effective in foraging and task management.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Pheromones</u><br />\\n\\t\\tPheromones (substances involved in chemical communication) are essential to honey-bee survival. Honey bees rely on pheromones for nearly all behaviors, including mating, alarm, defense, orientation, kin and colony recognition, food production and integrating colony activities.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Domestication</u><br />\\n\\t\\tThe honey bee is one of the few invertebrate animals to have been domesticated. Wild honey was collected by man in the Palaeolithic or Mesolithic periods, with evidence from rock art from France and Spain around 8,000 years old. Bees were likely first domesticated in ancient Egypt, where beekeeping is depicted in tomb paintings. Bees were brought to North America in 1622.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Beekeepers have selected bees for several desirable features:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tthe ability of a colony to survive periods with little food;</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tthe ability of a colony to survive cold weather;</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tresistance to disease;</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tincreased honey production;</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\treduced aggressiveness;</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\treduced tendency to swarm;</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\treduced nest building;</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\teasy pacification with smoke.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">These modifications, along with artificial change of location, have improved bees from the point of view of the beekeeper, and simultaneously made them more dependent on beekeepers for their survival. In Europe, cold weather survival was likely selected for, consciously or not, while in Africa, selection probably favoured the ability to survive heat, drought, and heavy rain.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Authors do not agree on whether this degree of artificial selection constitutes genuine domestication. In 1603, John Guillim wrote \\"The Bee I may well reckon a domestik Insect, being so pliable to the Benefit of the Keeper\\". More recently, many biologists working on pollination take the domesticated status of honey bees for granted. For example, Rachael Winfree and colleagues write \\"We used crop pollination as a model system, and investigated whether the loss of a domesticated pollinator (the honey bee) could be compensated for by native, wild bee species.\\" Similarly, Brian Dennis and William Kemp write that \\"Although the domestication of the honey bee is closely connected to the evolution of food-based socio-economic systems in many cultures throughout the world, in current economic terms, and in the U.S. alone, the estimated wholesale value of honey, more than $317 million dollars in 2013, pales in comparison to aggregate estimated annual value of pollination services, variously valued at $11–15 billion.\\"</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">On the other hand, P. R. Oxley and B. P. Oldroyd (2010) consider the domestication at best partial. Oldroyd observes that the lack of full domestication is somewhat surprising, given that people have kept bees for at least 7000 years. Instead, beekeepers have found ways to manage bees using hives, while the bees remain \\"largely unchanged from their wild cousins\\". Leslie Bailey and B. V. Ball, in their book Honey Bee Pathology, call honey bees \\"feral insects\\", in contrast to the silkworm (Bombyx mori) which they call \\"the only insect that has been domesticated\\", and refer to the \\"popular belief among many biologists as well as beekeepers that bees are domesticated\\". They argue that honey bees are able to survive without man\'s help, and in fact require to \\"be left at liberty\\" to survive. They argue further that even if bees could be raised away from the wild, they would still have to fly freely to gather nectar and pollinate plants. Therefore, they argue, beekeeping is \\"the exploitation of colonies of a wild insect\\", with little more than the provision of a weatherproof cavity for them to nest in. Pilar de la Rua and colleagues likewise argue that honey bees are not fully domesticated, since \\"endemic subspecies-specific genetic footprints can still be identified in Europe and Africa\\", making conservation of wild bee diversity important. They further argue that the difficulty of controlling drones for mating is a serious handicap and a sign that domestication is not complete, in particular as \\"extensive gene flow usually occurs between wild/feral and managed honeybee populations\\".</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Beekeeping</u><br />\\n\\t\\tThe honey bee is a colonial insect which is housed, fed and transported by beekeepers. Honey bees do not survive and reproduce individually, but as part of the colony (also known as a superorganism).</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Honey bees collect flower nectar and convert it to honey, which is stored in the hive. The nectar, transported in the bees\' stomachs, is converted with the addition of digestive enzymes and storage in a honey cell for partial dehydration. Nectar and honey provide the energy for the bees\' flight muscles and for heating the hive during the winter. Honey bees also collect pollen, which supplies protein and fat for the bee brood to grow. Centuries of selective breeding by humans have created bees which produce far more honey than the colony needs, and beekeepers (also known as apiarists) harvest the surplus honey.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Beekeepers provide a place for the colony to live and store honey. There are seven basic types of beehive: skeps, Langstroth hives, top-bar hives, box hives, log gums, D. E. hive, and miller hives. All U.S. states require beekeepers to use movable frames to allow bee inspectors to check the brood for disease. This allows beekeepers to keep Langstroth, top-bar and D.E. hives without special permission, granted for purposes such as museum use. Modern hives also enable beekeepers to transport bees, moving from field to field as crops require pollinating (a source of income for beekeepers).</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In cold climates, some beekeepers have kept colonies alive (with varying degrees of success) by moving them indoors for winter. While this can protect the colonies from extremes of temperature and make winter care and feeding more convenient for the beekeeper, it increases the risk of dysentery and causes an excessive buildup of carbon dioxide from the bees\' respiration. Inside wintering has been refined by Canadian beekeepers, who use large barns solely for the wintering of bees; automated ventilation systems assist in carbon-dioxide dispersal.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Products</u><br />\\n\\t\\tA primary product of honey bees is more honey bees. Honey bees are bought as mated queens, in spring packages of a queen with 2 to 5 pounds (0.91 to 2.27 kg) of bees, as nucleus colonies (which include frames of brood) and as full colonies. Commerce in bees dates to prehistory, and modern methods of producing queens and dividing colonies for increase date to the late 1800s. Bees are typically produced in temperate to tropical regions and sold to colder areas; packages of bees produced in Florida are sold to beekeepers in Michigan.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Pollination</u><br />\\n\\t\\tThe honey bee\'s primary commercial value is as a pollinator of crops. Although orchards and fields have increased in size, wild pollinators have dwindled. In a number of regions the pollination shortage is addressed by migratory beekeepers, who supply hives during a crop bloom and move them after the blooming period. Commercial beekeepers plan their movements and wintering locations according to anticipated pollination services. At higher latitudes it is difficult (or impossible) to winter over sufficient bees, or to have them ready for early blooming plants. Much migration is seasonal, with hives wintering in warmer climates and moving to follow the bloom at higher latitudes. In California almond pollination occurs in February, early in the growing season before local hives have built up their populations.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Almond orchards require two hives per acre (2,000 m² per hive) for maximum yield, and pollination is dependent on the importation of hives from warmer climates. Almond pollination (in February and March in the United States) is the largest managed pollination event in the world, requiring more than one-third of all managed honey bees in the country. Mass movements of bees are also made for apples in New York, Michigan, and Washington. Despite honey bees\' inefficiency as blueberry pollinators, large numbers are moved to Maine because they are the only pollinators who can be easily moved and concentrated for this and other monoculture crops. Bees and other insects maintain flower constancy by transferring pollen to other biologically specific plants; this prevents flower stigmas from being clogged with pollen from other species.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Honey</u><br />\\n\\t\\tHoney is the complex substance made from nectar and sweet deposits from plants and trees which are gathered, modified and stored in the comb by honey bees. Honey is a biological mixture of inverted sugars, primarily glucose and fructose. It has antibacterial and anti fungal properties. Honey from the Western honey bee, along with the bee Tetragonisca angustula, has specific antibacterial activity towards an infection causing bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus. Honey will not rot or ferment when stored under normal conditions, however it will crystallize over time. Although crystallized honey is acceptable for human use, bees can only use liquid honey and will remove and discard crystallized honey from the hive.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Bees produce honey by collecting nectar, a clear liquid consisting of nearly 80 percent water and complex sugars. The collecting bees store the nectar in a second stomach and return to the hive, where worker bees remove the nectar. The worker bees digest the raw nectar for about 30 minutes, using enzymes to break down the complex sugars into simpler ones. Raw honey is then spread in empty honeycomb cells to dry, reducing its water content to less than 20 percent. When nectar is being processed, honey bees create a draft through the hive by fanning with their wings. When the honey has dried, the honeycomb cells are sealed (capped) with wax to preserve it.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">When a hive detects smoke, many bees become nonaggressive; this is thought to be a defense mechanism. Wild colonies generally live in hollow trees; when they detect smoke, they are thought to prepare to evacuate from a forest fire with as much food as they can. To do this, they go to the nearest honey-storage cells and gorge on honey. In this state they are docile, since defending against predation is less important than saving as much food as possible.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Beeswax</u><br />\\n\\t\\tMature worker bees secrete beeswax from glands on their abdomen, using it to form the walls and caps of the comb. When honey is harvested, the wax can be collected for use in products like candles and seals.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Pollen</u><br />\\n\\t\\tBees collect pollen in a pollen basket and carry it back to the hive, where it is a protein source for brood-rearing. Excess pollen can be collected from the hive; although it is sometimes consumed as a dietary supplement by humans, bee pollen may cause an allergic reaction in susceptible individuals.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Propolis</u><br />\\n\\t\\tPropolis is a resinous mixture collected by honey bees from tree buds, sap flows or other botanical sources, which is used as a sealant for unwanted open spaces in the hive. Although propolis is alleged to have health benefits (tincture of Propolis is marketed as a cold and flu remedy), it may cause severe allergic reactions in some individuals. Propolis is also used in wood finishes, and gives a Stradivarius violin its unique red color.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Royal jelly</u><br />\\n\\t\\tRoyal jelly is a honey-bee secretion used to nourish the larvae. It is marketed for its alleged health benefits. On the other hand, it may cause severe allergic reactions in some individuals.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Genome</u><br />\\n\\t\\tAs of October 28, 2006, the Honey Bee Genome Sequencing Consortium fully sequenced and analyzed the genome of Apis mellifera. Since 2007, attention has been devoted to colony collapse disorder, a decline in European honey bee colonies in a number of regions.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The European honey bee is the third insect, after the fruit fly and the mosquito, to have its genome mapped. According to scientists who analyzed its genetic code, the honey bee originated in Africa and spread to Europe in two ancient migrations. Scientists have found that genes related to smell outnumber those for taste, and the European honey bee has fewer genes regulating immunity than the fruit fly and the mosquito. The genome sequence also revealed that several groups of genes, particularly those related to circadian rhythm, resembled those of vertebrates more than other insects. Another significant finding from the honey bee genome study was that honey bee was the first insect to be discovered with a functional DNA methylation system because functional key enzymes (DNA methyl-transferase 1 and 3) were identified in the genome. DNA methylation is one of the important mechanisms in epigenetics to study gene expression and regulation without changing the DNA sequence, but modifications on the DNA. DNA methylation later was identified to play an important role in gene regulation and gene alternative splicing. The genome is unusual in having few transposable elements, although they were present in the evolutionary past (inactive remains have been found) and evolved more slowly than those in fly species.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Hazards and survival</u><br />\\n\\t\\tEuropean honey-bee populations face threats to their survival, increasing interests in other pollinator species like B. impatiens. North American and European populations were severely depleted by varroa-mite infestations during the early 1990s, and US beekeepers were further affected by colony collapse disorder in 2006 and 2007. Improved cultural practices and chemical treatments against varroa mites saved most commercial operations; new bee breeds are beginning to reduce beekeeper dependence on acaricides. Feral bee populations were greatly reduced during this period; they are slowly recovering, primarily in mild climates, due to natural selection for varroa resistance and repopulation by resistant breeds. Insecticides, particularly when used in excess of label directions, have also depleted bee populations as bee pests and diseases (including American foulbrood and tracheal mites) are becoming resistant to medications.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Environmental hazards</u><br />\\n\\t\\tAfricanized bees have spread across the southern United States, where they pose a slight danger to humans (making beekeeping—particularly hobby beekeeping—difficult). As an invasive species, feral honey bees have become a significant environmental problem in non-native areas. Imported bees may displace native bees and birds, and may also promote the reproduction of invasive plants ignored by native pollinators. Unlike native bees, they do not properly extract or transfer pollen from plants with pore anthers (anthers which only release pollen through tiny apical pores); this requires buzz pollination, a behavior rarely exhibited by honey bees. Honey bees reduce fruiting in Melastoma affine, a plant with pore anthers, by robbing its stigmas of previously deposited pollen.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Predators</em><br />\\n\\t\\tInsect predators of honeybees include the Asian giant hornet and other wasps, robber flies, dragonflies such as the green darner, the European beewolf, some Praying mantises, and the water strider.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tArachnid predators of honeybees include fishing spiders, lynx spiders, goldenrod spiders and the St Andrew\'s Cross spider.</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tReptile and amphibian predators of honeybees include the American toad, Anole lizards, the American bullfrog and the wood Frog.</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tSpecialist bird predators include the bee-eaters; other birds that may take bees include grackles, hummingbirds, and tyrant flycatchers.</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tMammals that sometimes take bees include bears, least shrews, opossums, raccoons, honey badgers and skunks.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Close Relatives<br />\\n\\t\\tApart from Apis mellifera, there are 6 other species in the genus Apis. These are Apis andreniformis, Apis florea, Apis dorsata, Apis cerana, Apis koschevnikovi, and Apis nigrocincta. These other species all originated in South and Southeast Asia. Only Apis mellifera is thought to have originated in Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>\\n</div>\\n<hr />\\n<p>Reference Wikipedia</p>\\n",

The tail measures 11 to 24.5 cm (4.3 to 9.6 in) in length. Males usually weigh from 18 to 30 kg (40 to 66 lb) and females weigh 8 to 21 kg (18 to 46 lb). Male lynxes from Siberia, where the species reaches the largest body size, can weigh up to 38 kg (84 lb) or reportedly even 45 kg (99 lb). The race from the Carpathian Mountains can also grow quite large and rival those from Siberian in body mass in some cases. It has powerful, relatively long legs, with large webbed and furred paws that act like snowshoes. It also possesses a short \\"bobbed\\" tail with an all-black tip, black tufts of hair on its ears, and a long grey-and-white ruff.</p>\\r\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\r\\n\\t<p>During the summer, the Eurasian lynx has a relatively short, reddish or brown coat, which tends to be more brightly colored in animals living at the southern end of its range. In winter, however, this is replaced by a much thicker coat of silky fur that varies from silver-grey to greyish brown. The underparts of the animal, including the neck and chin, are white at all times of the year. The fur is almost always marked with black spots, although the number and pattern of these are highly variable. Some animals also possess dark brown stripes on the forehead and back. Although spots tend to be more numerous in animals from southern populations, Eurasian lynx with heavily spotted fur may exist close to others with plain fur.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>Eurasian lynx make a range of vocalizations, but are generally silent outside of the breeding season. They have been observed to mew, hiss, growl, and purr, and, like domestic cats, will \\"chatter\\" at prey that is just out of reach. Mating calls are much louder, consisting of deep growls in the male, and loud \\"meow\\"-like sounds in the female.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>Eurasian lynx are secretive, and because the sounds they make are very quiet and seldom heard, their presence in an area may go unnoticed for years. Remnants of prey or tracks on snow are usually observed long before the animal is seen.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>Behavior<br />\\r\\n\\t\\tLynx prey largely on small to fairly large sized mammals and birds. Among the recorded prey items for the species are hares, rabbits, marmots, squirrels, dormice, other rodents, mustelids (such as martens), grouse, red foxes, wild boar, chamois, young moose, roe deer, red deer, reindeer and other ungulates. Although taking on larger prey presents a risk to the animal, the bounty provided by killing them can outweigh the risks. The Eurasian lynx thus prefers fairly large ungulate prey, especially during winter when small prey is less abundant. They are the only Lynx species in which ungulates provide a great portion of their diet in relation to lagomorphs or rodents. Where common, roe deer appear to be the preferred prey species for the lynx. Even where roe deer are quite uncommon, the deer are still quantitatively the favored prey species, though in summer smaller prey and occasional domestic sheep are eaten more regularly. In parts of Finland, introduced white-tailed deer are eaten regularly. In some areas of Poland and Austria, red deer are the preferred prey and, in Switzerland, chamois may be locally favored. They will also feed on carrion when it is available. Adult lynx require 1.1 to 2 kilograms (2.4 to 4.4 lb) of meat per day, and may take several days to fully consume some of their larger prey.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>The main method of hunting is stalking, sneaking and jumping on prey, although they are also ambush predators when conditions are suitable. In winter certain snow conditions make this harder and the animal may be forced to switch to larger prey. Eurasian lynx hunt using both vision and hearing, and often climb onto high rocks or fallen trees to scan the surrounding area. A very powerful predator, these lynxes have successfully killed adult deer weighing to at least 150 kg (330 lb).</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>The Eurasian lynx inhabits rugged forested country providing plenty of hideouts and stalking opportunities. Depending on the locality, this may include forest-steppe, boreal forest, and montane forest. In the more mountainous parts of their range, Eurasian lynx will descend into the lowlands in winter, following their prey, and avoiding the deepest snows. They tend to be less common where wolves are abundant, and wolves have been reported to attack and even eat lynx. In Russian forests, the most important predators of the Eurasian lynx are the grey wolf. Wolves kill and eat lynxes that fail to escape into trees. Lynx populations decrease when wolves appear in a region and are likely to take smaller prey where wolves are active. Wolverines are perhaps the most dogged of competitors for kills, often stealing lynx kills. Lynxes tend to actively avoid encounters with wolverines, but may sometimes fight them if defending kittens. Instances of predation on lynx by wolverines may occur, even perhaps on adults, but unlike wolf attacks on lynx are extremely rare if they do in fact occur. One study in Sweden found that out of 33 deaths of lynx of a population being observed, one was probably killed by a wolverine. Another known instance of predation by an adult wolverine on an adult lynx was reportedly seen in the Pechora River area, although this appeared to merely be an anecdotal claim. There are no known instances of lynx preying on a wolverine. Sometimes, Siberian tigers have also preyed on lynxes, as evidenced by examination of tiger stomach contents. Lynx compete for food with the predators described above, and also with the red fox, eagle owls, golden eagles, wild boar (which scavenge from lynx kills), and in the southern part of its range, the snow leopard and leopard as well. Brown bears, although not (so far as is known) a predator of Eurasian lynx, are in some areas a semi-habitual usurpers of ungulate kills by lynxes, not infrequently before the cat has had a chance to consume its kill itself.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>Although they may hunt during the day when food is scarce, the Eurasian lynx is mainly nocturnal or crepuscular, and spends the day sleeping in dense thickets or other places of concealment. It lives solitarily as an adult.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>The hunting area of Eurasian lynx can be anything from 20 to 450 km2 (8 to 174 sq mi), depending on the local availability of prey. Males tend to hunt over much larger areas than females, which tend to occupy exclusive, rather than overlapping, hunting ranges. The Eurasian lynx can travel up to 20 km (12 mi) during one night, although about half this distance is more typical. They patrol regularly throughout all parts of their hunting range, using scent marks to indicate their presence to other individuals. As with other cats, the scent marks may consist of faeces, urine, or scrape marks, with the former often being left in prominent locations along the boundary of the hunting territory.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>Life Cycle<br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe mating season for Eurasian lynx lasts from January to April. The female typically comes into oestrus only once during this period, lasting from four to seven days, but if the first litter is lost, a second period of oestrus is common. Unlike the closely related Canada lynx, the Eurasian species does not appear to be able to control its reproductive behaviour based on prey availability. This may be because, feeding on a larger range of prey than the Canada lynx, rarity of suitable prey is a less common occurrence.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>Pregnant females construct dens in secluded locations, often protected by overhanging branches or tree roots. The den may be lined with feathers, deer hair, and dry grass to provide bedding for the young. Gestation lasts from 67 to 74 days, and results in the birth of from one to four kittens. At birth, Eurasian lynx kittens weigh 240 to 430 grams (8.5 to 15.2 oz) and are blind and helpless. They initially have plain, greyish-brown fur, attaining the full adult colouration around eleven weeks of age. The eyes open after ten to twelve days. The kittens begin to take solid food at six to seven weeks, when they begin to leave the den, but are not fully weaned for five or six months.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>The den is abandoned two to three months after the kittens are born, but the young typically remain with their mother until they are around ten months of age (the start of the next breeding season). Eurasian lynx reach sexual maturity at two or three years, and have lived for twenty one years in captivity.</p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n",

In British Columbia, adult males averaged 2.48 kg (5.5 lb) and adult females 2.11 kg (4.7 lb).[9] In Nova Scotia and New England, adult herons of both sexes averaged 2.23 kg (4.9 lb), while in Oregon, both sexes averaged 2.09 kg (4.6 lb) Thus, great blue herons are roughly twice as heavy as great egrets (Ardea alba), although only slightly taller than them, but they can weigh about half as much as a large goliath heron. Notable features of great blue herons include slaty (gray with a slight azure blue) flight feathers, red-brown thighs, and a paired red-brown and black stripe up the flanks; the neck is rusty-gray, with black and white streaking down the front; the head is paler, with a nearly white face, and a pair of black or slate plumes runs from just above the eye to the back of the head. The feathers on the lower neck are long and plume-like; it also has plumes on the lower back at the start of the breeding season. The bill is dull yellowish, becoming orange briefly at the start of the breeding season, and the lower legs are gray, also becoming orangey at the start of the breeding season. Immature birds are duller in color, with a dull blackish-gray crown, and the flank pattern is only weakly defined; they have no plumes, and the bill is dull gray-yellow. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 43–49.2 cm (16.9–19.4 in), the tail is 15.2–19.5 cm (6.0–7.7 in), the culmen is 12.3–15.2 cm (4.8–6.0 in), and the tarsus is 15.7–21 cm (6.2–8.3 in).</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tThe heron\'s stride is around 22 cm (8.7 in), almost in a straight line.

The great white heron differs from other great blues in bill morphology, head plume length, and in having a total lack of pigment in its plumage. It averages somewhat larger than the sympatric race A. h. wardi and may be the largest race in the species. In a survey of A. h. occidentalis in Florida, males were found to average 3.02 kg (6.7 lb) and females average 2.57 kg (5.7 lb), with a range for both sexes of 2 to 3.39 kg (4.4 to 7.5 lb).

The range extends south through Florida, Mexico, and the Caribbean to South America. Birds east of the Rocky Mountains in the northern part of their range are migratory and winter in Central America or northern South America. From the southern United States southwards, and on the Pacific coast, they are year-round residents.

Primary prey is variable based on availability and abundance. In Nova Scotia, 98% of the diet was flounders. In British Columbia, the primary prey species are sticklebacks, gunnels, sculpins, and perch. California herons were found to live mostly on sculpin, bass, perch, flounder, and top smelt. Nonpiscine prey is rarely quantitatively important, though one study in Idaho showed that from 24 to 40% of the diet was made up of voles.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHerons locate their food by sight and usually swallow it whole. They have been known to choke on prey that is too large. It is generally a solitary feeder. Individuals usually forage while standing in water, but also feed in fields or drop from the air, or a perch, into water. Mice are occasionally preyed on in upland areas far from the species\' typical aquatic environment. Occasionally, loose feeding flocks form and may be beneficial since they are able to locate schools of fish more easily. As large wading birds, great blue herons are capable of feeding in deeper waters, thus are able to harvest from niche areas not open to most other heron species. Typically, the great blue heron feeds in shallow waters, usually less than 50 cm (20 in) deep, or at the water\'s edge during both the night and the day, but especially around dawn and dusk. The most commonly employed hunting technique of the species is wading slowly with its long legs through shallow water and quickly spearing fish or frogs with its long, sharp bill. Although usually ponderous in movements, the great blue heron is adaptable in its fishing methods. Feeding behaviors variably have consisted of standing in one place, probing, pecking, walking at slow speeds, moving quickly, flying short distances and alighting, hovering over water and picking up prey, diving headfirst into the water, alighting on water feet-first, jumping from perches feet-first, and swimming or floating on the surface of the water.</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Breeding</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis species usually breeds in colonies, in trees close to lakes or other wetlands. Adults generally return to the colony site after winter from December (in warmer climes such as California and Florida) to March (in cooler areas such as Canada). Usually, colonies include only great blue herons, though sometimes they nest alongside other species of herons. These groups are called a heronry (a more specific term than \\"rookery\\"). The size of these colonies may be large, ranging between five and 500 nests per colony, with an average around 160 nests per colony. A heronry is usually relatively close, usually within 4 to 5 km (2.5 to 3.1 mi), to ideal feeding spots. Heronry sites are usually difficult to reach on foot (e.g., islands, trees in swamps, high branches, etc.) to protect from potential mammalian predators. Trees of any type are used when available. When not, herons may nest on the ground, sagebrush, cacti, channel markers, artificial platforms, beaver mounds, and duck blinds. Other waterbirds (especially smaller herons) and, occasionally, even fish and mammal-eating raptors may nest amongst colonies. Although nests are often reused for many years and herons are socially monogamous within a single breeding season, individuals usually choose new mates each year. Males arrive at colonies first and settle on nests, where they court females; most males choose a different nest each year. Great blue herons build a bulky stick nest. Nests are usually around 50 cm (20 in) across when first constructed, but can grow to more than 120 cm (47 in) in width and 90 cm (35 in) deep with repeated use and additional construction. If the nest is abandoned or destroyed, the female may lay a replacement clutch. Reproduction is negatively affected by human disturbance, particularly during the beginning of nesting. Repeated human intrusion into nesting areas often results in nest failure, with abandonment of eggs or chicks. However, Vancouver B.C. Canada\'s Stanley Park has had a healthy colony for some years right near its main entrance and tennis courts adjacent to English Bay and not far from Lost Lagoon. The park\'s colony has had as many as 140 nests. The Stanley Park Colony can be observed at their interactive web cam at http://vancouver.ca/parks-recreation-culture/heron-cam.aspx</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe female lays three to six pale blue eggs. Eggs can measure from 50.7 to 76.5 mm (2.00 to 3.01 in) in length and 29 to 50.5 mm (1.14 to 1.99 in) in width, though the smallest eggs in the above sample may have been consider \\"runt eggs\\" too small to produce viable young. Egg weight ranges from 61 to 80 g (2.2 to 2.8 oz). One brood is raised each year. First broods are laid generally from March to April. Eggs are usually laid at two-day intervals, incubated around 27 days, and hatch asynchronously over a period of several days. Males incubate for about 10.5 hours of each day, while females usually incubate for the remainder of each day and the night, with eggs left without incubation for about 6 minutes of each hour. The first chick to hatch usually becomes more experienced in food handling and aggressive interactions with siblings, so often grows more quickly than the other chicks. Both parents feed the young at the nest by regurgitating food. Parent birds have been shown to consume up to four times as much food when they are feeding young chicks (about 4300 kJ/day) than when laying or incubating eggs (about 1200 kJ/day). By the time they are 45 days old, the young weigh 86% of the adult\'s mass. After about 55 days at the northern edge of the range (Alberta) and 80 days at the southern edge of the range (California), young herons take their first flight. They return to the nest to be fed for about another 3 weeks, following adults back from foraging grounds, and are likely to gradually disperse away from their original nest over the course of the ensuing winter. Young herons are not as successful at fish capture as adults, as strike rates are similar, but capture rates are about half that of adults during the first 2 months after fledging.</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<u>Predation</u></div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPredators of eggs and nestlings include turkey vultures (Cathartes aura), common ravens (Corvus corax), and American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos). Red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), American black bears (Ursus americanus), and raccoons (Procyon lotor) are known to take larger nestlings or fledglings and, in the latter predator, many eggs. Adult herons, due to their size, have few natural predators, but a few of the larger avian predators have been known to kill both young and adults, including bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) (the only predator known to attack great blue herons at every stage of their lifecycle from in the egg to adulthood), golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) and, less frequently, great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) and Harris\'s hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus). An occasional adult or, more likely, an unsteady fledgling may be snatched by an American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) or an American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus). Using its considerable size and dagger-like bill, a full-grown heron can be a formidable foe to a predator. In one instance, during an act of attempted predation by a golden eagle, a heron was able to mortally wound the eagle although it succumbed to injures sustained in the fight. When predation on an adult or chick occurs at a breeding colony, the colony can sometimes be abandoned by the other birds. The primary source of disturbance and breeding failures at heronries is human activities, mostly through human recreation or habitat destruction, as well as by egg-collectors and hunters.</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<strong>In art</strong></div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJohn James Audubon illustrates the great blue heron in Birds of America, Second Edition (published, London 1827–38) as Plate 161.

Nonpiscine prey is rarely quantitatively important, though one study in Idaho showed that from 24 to 40% of the diet was made up of voles.</p>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t </div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHerons locate their food by sight and usually swallow it whole. They have been known to choke on prey that is too large. It is generally a solitary feeder. Individuals usually forage while standing in water, but also feed in fields or drop from the air, or a perch, into water. Mice are occasionally preyed on in upland areas far from the species\' typical aquatic environment. Occasionally, loose feeding flocks form and may be beneficial since they are able to locate schools of fish more easily. As large wading birds, great blue herons are capable of feeding in deeper waters, thus are able to harvest from niche areas not open to most other heron species. Typically, the great blue heron feeds in shallow waters, usually less than 50 cm (20 in) deep, or at the water\'s edge during both the night and the day, but especially around dawn and dusk. The most commonly employed hunting technique of the species is wading slowly with its long legs through shallow water and quickly spearing fish or frogs with its long, sharp bill. Although usually ponderous in movements, the great blue heron is adaptable in its fishing methods. Feeding behaviors variably have consisted of standing in one place, probing, pecking, walking at slow speeds, moving quickly, flying short distances and alighting, hovering over water and picking up prey, diving headfirst into the water, alighting on water feet-first, jumping from perches feet-first, and swimming or floating on the surface of the water.</div>\\n<div>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Breeding</u><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis species usually breeds in colonies, in trees close to lakes or other wetlands. Adults generally return to the colony site after winter from December (in warmer climes such as California and Florida) to March (in cooler areas such as Canada). Usually, colonies include only great blue herons, though sometimes they nest alongside other species of herons. These groups are called a heronry (a more specific term than \\"rookery\\"). The size of these colonies may be large, ranging between five and 500 nests per colony, with an average around 160 nests per colony. A heronry is usually relatively close, usually within 4 to 5 km (2.5 to 3.1 mi), to ideal feeding spots. Heronry sites are usually difficult to reach on foot (e.g., islands, trees in swamps, high branches, etc.) to protect from potential mammalian predators. Trees of any type are used when available. When not, herons may nest on the ground, sagebrush, cacti, channel markers, artificial platforms, beaver mounds, and duck blinds. Other waterbirds (especially smaller herons) and, occasionally, even fish and mammal-eating raptors may nest amongst colonies. Although nests are often reused for many years and herons are socially monogamous within a single breeding season, individuals usually choose new mates each year. Males arrive at colonies first and settle on nests, where they court females; most males choose a different nest each year. Great blue herons build a bulky stick nest. Nests are usually around 50 cm (20 in) across when first constructed, but can grow to more than 120 cm (47 in) in width and 90 cm (35 in) deep with repeated use and additional construction. If the nest is abandoned or destroyed, the female may lay a replacement clutch. Reproduction is negatively affected by human disturbance, particularly during the beginning of nesting. Repeated human intrusion into nesting areas often results in nest failure, with abandonment of eggs or chicks. However, Vancouver B.C. Canada\'s Stanley Park has had a healthy colony for some years right near its main entrance and tennis courts adjacent to English Bay and not far from Lost Lagoon. The park\'s colony has had as many as 140 nests. The Stanley Park Colony can be observed at their interactive web cam at <a href=\\"http://vancouver.ca/parks-recreation-culture/heron-cam.aspx\\">http://vancouver.ca/parks-recreation-culture/heron-cam.aspx</a></p>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe female lays three to six pale blue eggs. Eggs can measure from 50.7 to 76.5 mm (2.00 to 3.01 in) in length and 29 to 50.5 mm (1.14 to 1.99 in) in width, though the smallest eggs in the above sample may have been consider \\"runt eggs\\" too small to produce viable young. Egg weight ranges from 61 to 80 g (2.2 to 2.8 oz). One brood is raised each year. First broods are laid generally from March to April. Eggs are usually laid at two-day intervals, incubated around 27 days, and hatch asynchronously over a period of several days. Males incubate for about 10.5 hours of each day, while females usually incubate for the remainder of each day and the night, with eggs left without incubation for about 6 minutes of each hour. The first chick to hatch usually becomes more experienced in food handling and aggressive interactions with siblings, so often grows more quickly than the other chicks. Both parents feed the young at the nest by regurgitating food. Parent birds have been shown to consume up to four times as much food when they are feeding young chicks (about 4300 kJ/day) than when laying or incubating eggs (about 1200 kJ/day). By the time they are 45 days old, the young weigh 86% of the adult\'s mass. After about 55 days at the northern edge of the range (Alberta) and 80 days at the southern edge of the range (California), young herons take their first flight. They return to the nest to be fed for about another 3 weeks, following adults back from foraging grounds, and are likely to gradually disperse away from their original nest over the course of the ensuing winter. Young herons are not as successful at fish capture as adults, as strike rates are similar, but capture rates are about half that of adults during the first 2 months after fledging.</div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t </div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<u>Predation</u></div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPredators of eggs and nestlings include turkey vultures (Cathartes aura), common ravens (Corvus corax), and American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos). Red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), American black bears (Ursus americanus), and raccoons (Procyon lotor) are known to take larger nestlings or fledglings and, in the latter predator, many eggs. Adult herons, due to their size, have few natural predators, but a few of the larger avian predators have been known to kill both young and adults, including bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) (the only predator known to attack great blue herons at every stage of their lifecycle from in the egg to adulthood), golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) and, less frequently, great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) and Harris\'s hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus). An occasional adult or, more likely, an unsteady fledgling may be snatched by an American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) or an American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus). Using its considerable size and dagger-like bill, a full-grown heron can be a formidable foe to a predator. In one instance, during an act of attempted predation by a golden eagle, a heron was able to mortally wound the eagle although it succumbed to injures sustained in the fight. When predation on an adult or chick occurs at a breeding colony, the colony can sometimes be abandoned by the other birds. The primary source of disturbance and breeding failures at heronries is human activities, mostly through human recreation or habitat destruction, as well as by egg-collectors and hunters.</div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t </div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<strong>In art</strong></div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJohn James Audubon illustrates the great blue heron in Birds of America, Second Edition (published, London 1827–38) as Plate 161.

Because these trees are larger than the rest of the forest, they present a lightning hazard to the nesting birds.</p>\\r\\n<p><!--\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) is a large woodpecker native to North America. Roughly crow-sized, it normally inhabits deciduous forests in eastern North America, the Great Lakes, the boreal forests of Canada, and parts of the Pacific coast. It is the second largest woodpecker in the United States, after the critically endangered and possibly extinct ivory-billed woodpecker.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Description</strong><br />\\r\\n\\tAdults are 40 to 49 cm (16 to 19 in) long, span 66 to 75 cm (26 to 30 in) across the wings and weigh 250 to 400 g (8.8 to 14.1 oz), with an average weight of 300 g (11 oz). Each wing measures 21.4 to 25.3 cm (8.4 to 10.0 in), the tail measures 14 to 17.4 cm (5.5 to 6.9 in), the bill is 4.1–6 cm (1.6–2.4 in) and the tarsus measures 3.1–3.8 cm (1.2–1.5 in). They are mainly black with a red crest, and have a white line down the sides of the throat. They show white on the wings in flight. The flight of these birds is strong and direct but has an undulating quality, similar to the relatively unique flight-style of all woodpeckers. Adult males have a red line from the bill to the throat, in adult females these are black. Two species found in the Old World, the white-bellied and black woodpeckers are closely related and occupy the same ecological niche in their respective ranges that the pileated occupies in North America. The only North American birds of similar plumage and size are the ivory-billed woodpecker of the Southeastern United States and Cuba, and the related imperial woodpecker of Mexico. However, unlike the pileated, both of those species are extremely rare, if not extinct. Most reports of the ivory-billed woodpecker are believed to be erroneous reports of the far more common pileated.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The call is a loud, far-carrying laugh, sometimes described as a \\"jungle bird\\" call due to its wild, un-fettered quality. The northern flicker, which is very different looking and weighs about half as much as a pileated, has a similar-sounding call but has a weaker voice. Its drumming can be very loud, often sounding like someone striking a tree with a hammer.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Subspecies</strong><br />\\r\\n\\tUp to four subspecies of pileated woodpeckers have been recognized historically. However, many authors only recognize two subspecies, the southernly D. p. pileatus and the northerly D. p. abieticola, and the differences between the other two subspecies other than range are not well described. Generally, pileated woodpeckers follow Bergmann\'s rule being smaller and more compact in the south (pileatus) and larger in the North (abieticola). The ranges of the potential four subspecies are described below.</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\tSouthern pileated woodpecker (D. p. pileatus) – the southeastern U.S., except Florida.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\tNorthern pileated woodpecker (D. p. abieticola) – Distributed from the Canadian Prairies provinces east through Eastern Canada and the northern United States.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\tFlorida pileated woodpecker (D. p. floridanus) –the Florida peninsula and Florida Keys.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\tWestern pileated woodpecker (D. p. picinus) – western North America.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong><br />\\r\\n\\tTheir breeding habitat is forested areas across Canada, the eastern United States and parts of the Pacific coast. This bird favors mature forests and heavily wooded parks. They specifically prefer mesic habitats with large, mature hardwood trees, often being found in large tracts of forest. However, they also inhabit smaller woodlots as long as they have a scattering of tall trees.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Behavior</strong><br />\\r\\n\\tThese birds mainly eat insects, especially carpenter ants and wood-boring beetle larvae. They also eat fruits, nuts, and berries, including poison ivy berries. Pileated woodpeckers will often chip out large and roughly rectangular holes in trees while searching out insects, especially ant galleries. They also will lap up ants by reaching with their long tongue into crevices. They are self-assured on the vertical surfaces of large trees but can seem awkward while feeding on small branches and vines. Pileated woodpeckers may also forage on or near the ground, especially around fallen, dead trees, which can contain a smorgasbord of insect life. They may forage around the sides of human homes or even cars and can occasionally be attracted to suet-type feeders. Although they are less likely feeder visitors than smaller woodpeckers, pileateds may regularly be attracted to them in areas experiencing harsh winter conditions.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Usually, pileated woodpeckers excavate their large nests in the cavities of dead trees. Woodpeckers make such large holes in dead trees that the holes can cause a small tree to break in half. The roost of a pileated woodpecker usually has multiple entrance holes. Pileated woodpeckers raise their young every year in a hole in a tree. In April, the hole made by the male attracts a female for mating and raising their young. Once the brood is raised, the pileated woodpeckers abandon the hole and will not use it the next year. When abandoned, these holes—made similarly by all woodpeckers—provide good homes in future years for many forest song birds and a wide variety of other animals. Owls and tree-nesting ducks may largely rely on holes made by pileateds in which to lay their nests. Even mammals such as raccoons may use them. Other woodpeckers and smaller birds such as wrens may be attracted to pileated holes to feed on the insects found in them. Ecologically, the entire woodpecker family is important to the well being of many other bird species. The pileated woodpecker will also nest in nest boxes about 4.6 m (15 ft) off the ground.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">A pileated woodpecker pair stays together on its territory all year round and is a non-migratory species. It will defend the territory in all seasons, but will tolerate floaters during the winter.

Because these trees are larger than the rest of the forest, they present a lightning hazard to the nesting birds.</p>\\n<p><!--\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><p>The pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) is a large woodpecker native to North America. Roughly crow-sized, it normally inhabits deciduous forests in eastern North America, the Great Lakes, the boreal forests of Canada, and parts of the Pacific coast. It is the second largest woodpecker in the United States, after the critically endangered and possibly extinct ivory-billed woodpecker.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Description</strong><br />\\n\\tAdults are 40 to 49 cm (16 to 19 in) long, span 66 to 75 cm (26 to 30 in) across the wings and weigh 250 to 400 g (8.8 to 14.1 oz), with an average weight of 300 g (11 oz). Each wing measures 21.4 to 25.3 cm (8.4 to 10.0 in), the tail measures 14 to 17.4 cm (5.5 to 6.9 in), the bill is 4.1–6 cm (1.6–2.4 in) and the tarsus measures 3.1–3.8 cm (1.2–1.5 in). They are mainly black with a red crest, and have a white line down the sides of the throat. They show white on the wings in flight. The flight of these birds is strong and direct but has an undulating quality, similar to the relatively unique flight-style of all woodpeckers. Adult males have a red line from the bill to the throat, in adult females these are black. Two species found in the Old World, the white-bellied and black woodpeckers are closely related and occupy the same ecological niche in their respective ranges that the pileated occupies in North America. The only North American birds of similar plumage and size are the ivory-billed woodpecker of the Southeastern United States and Cuba, and the related imperial woodpecker of Mexico. However, unlike the pileated, both of those species are extremely rare, if not extinct. Most reports of the ivory-billed woodpecker are believed to be erroneous reports of the far more common pileated.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The call is a loud, far-carrying laugh, sometimes described as a \\"jungle bird\\" call due to its wild, un-fettered quality. The northern flicker, which is very different looking and weighs about half as much as a pileated, has a similar-sounding call but has a weaker voice. Its drumming can be very loud, often sounding like someone striking a tree with a hammer.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Subspecies</strong><br />\\n\\tUp to four subspecies of pileated woodpeckers have been recognized historically. However, many authors only recognize two subspecies, the southernly D. p. pileatus and the northerly D. p. abieticola, and the differences between the other two subspecies other than range are not well described. Generally, pileated woodpeckers follow Bergmann\'s rule being smaller and more compact in the south (pileatus) and larger in the North (abieticola). The ranges of the potential four subspecies are described below.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\tSouthern pileated woodpecker (D. p. pileatus) – the southeastern U.S., except Florida.</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\tNorthern pileated woodpecker (D. p. abieticola) – Distributed from the Canadian Prairies provinces east through Eastern Canada and the northern United States.</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\tFlorida pileated woodpecker (D. p. floridanus) –the Florida peninsula and Florida Keys.</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\tWestern pileated woodpecker (D. p. picinus) – western North America.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong><br />\\n\\tTheir breeding habitat is forested areas across Canada, the eastern United States and parts of the Pacific coast. This bird favors mature forests and heavily wooded parks. They specifically prefer mesic habitats with large, mature hardwood trees, often being found in large tracts of forest. However, they also inhabit smaller woodlots as long as they have a scattering of tall trees.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Behavior</strong><br />\\n\\tThese birds mainly eat insects, especially carpenter ants and wood-boring beetle larvae. They also eat fruits, nuts, and berries, including poison ivy berries. Pileated woodpeckers will often chip out large and roughly rectangular holes in trees while searching out insects, especially ant galleries. They also will lap up ants by reaching with their long tongue into crevices. They are self-assured on the vertical surfaces of large trees but can seem awkward while feeding on small branches and vines. Pileated woodpeckers may also forage on or near the ground, especially around fallen, dead trees, which can contain a smorgasbord of insect life. They may forage around the sides of human homes or even cars and can occasionally be attracted to suet-type feeders. Although they are less likely feeder visitors than smaller woodpeckers, pileateds may regularly be attracted to them in areas experiencing harsh winter conditions.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Usually, pileated woodpeckers excavate their large nests in the cavities of dead trees. Woodpeckers make such large holes in dead trees that the holes can cause a small tree to break in half. The roost of a pileated woodpecker usually has multiple entrance holes. Pileated woodpeckers raise their young every year in a hole in a tree. In April, the hole made by the male attracts a female for mating and raising their young. Once the brood is raised, the pileated woodpeckers abandon the hole and will not use it the next year. When abandoned, these holes—made similarly by all woodpeckers—provide good homes in future years for many forest song birds and a wide variety of other animals. Owls and tree-nesting ducks may largely rely on holes made by pileateds in which to lay their nests. Even mammals such as raccoons may use them. Other woodpeckers and smaller birds such as wrens may be attracted to pileated holes to feed on the insects found in them. Ecologically, the entire woodpecker family is important to the well being of many other bird species. The pileated woodpecker will also nest in nest boxes about 4.6 m (15 ft) off the ground.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">A pileated woodpecker pair stays together on its territory all year round and is a non-migratory species. It will defend the territory in all seasons, but will tolerate floaters during the winter. When clashing with conspecifics, they engage in much chasing, calling, striking with the wings, and jabbing with the bill. Drumming is most commonly to proclaim a territory and hollow trees are often used to make the largest sound possible.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Pileated woodpeckers have been observed to move to another site if any eggs have fallen out of the nest—a rare habit in birds.

The head and body length can range from 80 mm to 130 mm, while the length of the tail can range from 60 mm to 113 mm. The range of its body mass is between 18 grams and 34 grams. The fur on the upper parts of the body is grayish-brown while the underparts are yellowish-white. A black stripe surrounds the eye and extends to the small ear. The whiskers form a bushy tuft about 10mm long. There are six pads on each paw. It has bilateral symmetry and is endothermic.</p>\\r\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Distribution and habitat </u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe range of the forest dormouse is from Switzerland in the west, through central, eastern and southern Europe, the Balkan Peninsula, northward to the Baltic Sea and eastward to the Volga River and the Ural Mountains in Russia. Isolated populations occur outside this range, including in Israel, central Iran, Afghanistan, the Tien Shan mountains and Sinkiang in China. The forest dormouse lives in a wide range of habitats, including broad-leaved, mixed and coniferous woodlands. It is also found in rocky areas, dwarf montane woodland, evergreen shrubland and wood-steppe. It is reported to be found at altitudes up to 3,500 m. This species is most likely to be found in dense forests. Forest dormice tend to create their natal nests on top of lower tree branches or in the midst of thick shrubbery. These nests are usually one to seven meters above ground level. They are spherically shaped with a diameter between 150mm to 250mm. Typically these nests only have one entrance and it faces the tree trunk. The outside of the nest is made from leaves and twigs. The inside of the nest has a lining that is created from bark and moss pieces. Forest dormice tend to pay great attention to detail when they create these natal nests. They want to make sure their young are protected.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Biology</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tDepending on where this species is geographical located determines whether or not it hibernates and for how long. In Israel, forest dormice stay active throughout the year. However, during the winter they do go through a period of torpor for a certain amount of time each day. Forest dormice located in the north tend to hibernate from October until April. During this period of hibernation, northern dormice will sit on their back legs and curl up into a ball. Its tail will wrap around its body and its hands may touch its cheeks. In all hibernating species, body temperature decreases from the range of 35-37 °C to about 5 °C. Not much is known about the mating rituals of this species. It is known that this species is dependent on maternal care for the first couple of weeks after birth. Female forest dormice have eight mammary glands. Forest dormice breed during various times of the year depending on their geographical location. For example, forest dormice who live in Israel have a breeding season that starts in March and lasts until December. However, in Europe breeding season is much shorter as it starts in March and only lasts until the end of August. There is a correlation between length of the breeding season and number of litters produced per year. For this reason, forest dormice who live in the south who have a longer breeding season usually produce two litters while the dormice who live in the north and have a very short breeding season usually only have time to produce one litter. The gestation period lasts about four weeks, and usually four or five young are born per litter. From time to time, it is possible for the female to give birth to up to seven young at one time. When the young are born, they weigh about 2 grams. The young dormice open their eyes at two weeks, and start eating solid food a week later. During the dependency period, the mother provides food, milk, grooming, and protection to the young. They leave the nest after about another three weeks and become sexually mature in the following year. There has not been much evidence for paternal care. However, it should not be ruled out. The average lifespan of forest dormice in the wild is five and a half years. The gender ratio is about 1:1, with insignificant predominance of females.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Ecology</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tWhen it comes out of hibernation in the spring, the forest dormouse eats small invertebrates, baby birds, buds, shoots and the green parts of plants. Later in the year, the dormouse predominately eats fruits, nuts and seeds. In fact, this species eats fruits from about twenty different tree and bush species including: apricots, apples, cherries, plums, cherry plums, pears, peaches, blackberries. The population does not fluctuate much because the young reared each year only just makes up for those that die during hibernation. Sixty percent of young individuals and the majority of elderly adults (over the age of four) do not survive the winter. Another cause of mortality is storms which may cause the death of juveniles in unprotected nests. Dormice are also preyed upon by pine marten, stone martens, wildcats, owls and crows. Two of its main predators are tawny owls (Strix aluco) and Eurasian eagle-owls (Bubo bubo). However, due to individuals being extremely careful not to travel away from brushy cover forest dormice are difficult prey to find. Forest dormice are very aggressive. Not even in captivity are they tame. It has been noted that they may allow humans to pet them. However, when efforts are made to hold them, they bite with their sharp teeth. If agitated while resting they may wake up suddenly, leap high, spit, and hiss. Forest dormice may have a negative impact for humans due to raiding fruit orchards and chewing on the bark of coniferous trees. They have also been known to be vectors for such diseases as tick-borne encephalitis, leptospirosis, and possibly the Black Death. They may have a positive impact by controlling arthropod populations and scattering seeds.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Behavior</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tForest dormice spend a great amount of time in trees. They are capable of climbing with excellent agility as well as leap to and from branches as great as 2 meters apart from one another. This species has a natural tendency to create temporary nests which are fragile. This species does not spend much time in these temporary nests because much more energy is placed in making the natal nests. This species is nocturnal. It is also very territorial. Adults live in low densities, usually only two to three per acre. Their territory range is from 65 to 100 m (213 to 328 ft) in diameter. Forest dormice produce a variety of noises for a variety of reasons. The most significant is the sound for an alarm call which is a melodious squeak. They also have the ability to produce ultrasounds which are used for communication. The different communication methods that forest dormice use are visual, tactile, acoustic, and chemical. It is not known exactly how these forms of communication are used specifically for this species. However, it is known that most mammals use tactile communication during mating, conflict, and raising young. Chemical communication can play a significant role in being able to identify a specific individual. Visual cues are given off by body posture as a way to designate whether it is a hostile or friendly environment. The different perception methods that forest dormice use are visual, tactile, ultrasound, and chemical.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Status</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThis species is considered endangered in the Czech Republic and as rare in a majority of the other European countries. The population is mostly threatened by the destruction of forests which is their habitat. There are many programs in place to help maintain and increase the forest dormice population. There is an international law to protect this species and it is under the EU Habitats and Species Directive (Annex IV) and the Berne Convention (Appendix III). All countries must abide by this law. In addition, a country may choose to create a national law or program in order to further provide methods to make sure this species is protected. For example, the English government rewards farmers who replant hedges. Hopefully, this will increase available shrubbery for dormice to occupy. Another program is administered by English Nature. This is a reintroduction program whose purpose is to place captive-bred dormice in locations where the population has been dwindling. In addition to these programs, the UK has created a National Dormouse Monitoring Programme. Its main purpose is to observe hazel dormice. However, the program components are used to observe and track all species of dormice</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Ancestry</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tRecently, a fossil of a dormouse-like mammal was discovered.

It is applied in a single dose when adults are most active (August/September).</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Reference</strong><br />\\n\\t<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megacyllene_robiniae\\">wikipedia</a></p>\\n",

It is a hard-bodied tick (family Ixodidae) of the eastern and northern Midwestern United States. It is a vector for several diseases of animals, including humans (Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, Powassan virus disease, etc.) and is known as the deer tick owing to its habit of parasitizing the white-tailed deer. It is also known to parasitize mice, lizards, migratory birds, etc. especially while the tick is in the larval or nymphal stage.</p>\\r\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\r\\n  <p>Description<br />\\r\\n    When the deer tick has consumed a blood meal, its abdomen will be a light grayish-blue color, whereas the tick itself is chiefly black. In identifying an engorged tick, it is helpful to concentrate on the legs and upper part of the body.</p>\\r\\n  <p>Behavior<br />\\r\\n    I. scapularis has a two-year life cycle, during which time it passes through three stages: larva, nymph, and adult. The tick must take a blood meal at each stage before maturing to the next. Deer tick females latch onto a host and drink its blood for four to five days. Deer are the preferred host of the deer tick, but it is also known to feed on small rodents.[5] After she is engorged, the tick drops off and overwinters in the leaf litter of the forest floor. The following spring, the female lays several hundred to a few thousand eggs in clusters. Transtadial (between tick stages) passage of Borrelia burgdorferi is common. Vertical passage (from mother to egg) of Borrelia is uncommon.</p>\\r\\n  <p>Ticks are very hardy creatures and I. scapularis is no exception. They will be active even after a moderate to severe frost, as daytime temperatures can warm them enough to keep them actively searching for a host. In the spring, they can be one of the first invertebrates to become active. Deer ticks can be quite numerous and seemingly gregarious in areas where they are found.</p>\\r\\n  <p>As disease vector<br />\\r\\n    Ixodes scapularis is the main vector of Lyme disease in North America. It can also transmit other Borrelia species, including Borrelia miyamotoi. Ticks that transmit B. burgdorferi to humans can also carry and transmit several other parasites, such as Theileria microti and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, which cause the diseases babesiosis and human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), respectively. Among early Lyme disease patients, depending on their location, 2%–12% will also have HGA and 2%–40% will have babesiosis.</p>\\r\\n  <p>Co-infections complicate Lyme symptoms, especially diagnosis and treatment. It is possible for a tick to carry and transmit one of the co-infections and not Borrelia, making diagnosis difficult and often elusive.

Ticks acquire Lyme disease microbes by feeding on infected mice and other small rodents.</p>\\r\\n  <p>One of the keys of the success of I. scapularis as a Borrelia vector relies on its ability to limit the proliferation of the spirochaete. This is due to the activity of domesticated amidase effector (dae) genes. Dae genes are a family of horizontally acquired genes related to type VI secretion amidase effector (tae) genes in certain bacteria which encode toxins honed to mediate interbacterial antagonism. Once transferred to eukaryotes tae genes confer novel antibacterial capabilities; this provides a selective advantage to the tick and to other eukaryotes also: tae genes have been transferred from bacteria to eukaryotes at least in six independent events. In particular, I. scapularis have inherited the dae 2 family from a common ancestor between ticks and mites. The product of dae2 expression has been shown to degrade bacterial peptidoglycan of different species and particularly from B. burgdorferi, but does not limit initial acquisition of the bacterium by the tick.

The shell is smooth with a sculpturing of fine concentric growth lines but no radiating ribs. The shells of this species are purple, blue or sometimes brown in color, occasionally with radial stripes. The outer surface of the shell is covered by the periostracum which as eroded, exposes the colored prismatic calcitic layer. Blue Mussels are semi-sessile, having the ability to detach and reattach to a surface allowing the mollusk to reposition itself relative to the water position.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Reproduction</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tMussels have separate sexes. Once the sperm and eggs are fully developed they are released into the water column for fertilization. Although there are about 10,000 sperm per egg, large proportions of eggs deposited by blue mussel are never fertilized. As few as 1% of larvae that do mature ever reach adulthood, the majority are eaten by predators before completing metamorphosis.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The reproductive strategy seen in blue mussels is characteristic of planktotrophs, by minimizing nutrients in egg production to the bare minimum they are able to maximize the number of gametes produced. If the adult mussels are stressed during the beginning of gametogenesis, the process is terminated.[4] When stressed while fresh gametes are present, adult mussels reabsorb gametes. Larvae viability is also affected by the condition of parents: high water temperatures, pollutants and scarcity of food, during gamete production. The reduction in viability is probably due to the lack of lipid reserves distributed to the eggs.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Larval development</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tLarval development can last from 15 to 35 days depending environmental conditions including salinity and temperature, as well as location. Larvae originating from Connecticut mature normally at 15–20 °C (59–68 °F), though at 15 °C (59 °F) normal development occurs at salinities between 15 and 35 ppt and 20 at 35 ppt at 20 °C (68 °F).</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The first stage of development is the ciliated embryo, which in 24-hours for fertilization form the trochophore. At this point although mobile, it is still reliant on the yolk for nutrients. Characterized by a functional mouth and alimentary canal the veliger stage also has cilia which are used for filtering food as well as propulsion. A thin translucent shell is secreted by the shell gland forming the notable straight hinge of the prodissoconch I shell. The veliger continues to mature forming the prodissoconch II shell. In the end stage of veliger development photosensitive eye spots and elongated foot with a byssal gland are formed.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Once the pediveliger is fully developed, its foot extends and makes contact with substrate. The initial contact with the substrate is loose. If the substrate is suitable, the larva will metamorphoses into the juvenile form, plantigrade, and attach byssus threads. The mussel will remain in that state until reaching 1-1.5mm in length. This attachment is the prerequisite for the foundation for the blue mussel population. In sheltered environments large masses sometimes form beds which offer shelter and food for other invertebrates. Byssal thread are secreted by byssal glands located in the foot of the mussel, and are made up of polyphenolic proteins are proteins which serve as a bioadhesive.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Aggregation</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tBlue mussels occasionally form clumps, or aggregates, of individuals when population density is low.The mussels attach to one another via collagenous protein strands called byssal threads. The aggregates are observed mostly in Mussel fields, which are short-lived populations of Mussels, usually exhibiting a clumped distribution pattern. It is hypothesized that the mussels form these aggregates to increase reproductive success in low density populations. This hypothesis, however, has yet to be conclusively proven. Alternative possible reasons for the behavior include resisting wave action and increasing water flow through the siphons of the mussel. The significance of the behavior is its relation to the formation of mussel beds from mussel fields. Mussel beds are persistent, dense mussel populations. Beds generally form from fields that persist long enough to establish a dense population. Thus in areas where blue mussels are threatened, such as the Wadden Sea, it is of great importance to enhance the survival of mussel fields, of which mussel aggregates are the primary component.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Predators</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tPredation of blue mussels is greatest during the 3 weeks it spends as a planktonic larva.

Once it metamorphoses the mussel is still restricted by predation, with smaller mussels with thinner, weaker shells most affected. Once the shells becomes stronger, blue mussels are preyed upon by sea stars such as Asterias vulgaris as well as by several species of sea gulls. The capability of shell thickening by mussels has become a very effective defense mechanism. In the presence of predators a mussel is able to increase shell thickness 5 to 10 percent, which in turn makes opening the shell take 50 percent more time. Small mussels are also eaten by the dog whelk, Nucella lapillus.

They average about one meter in length, but can reach total body lengths of almost two meters. These lizards can also have horizontal bands on either their backs or tails, along with yellow spots across their backs. Their young are normally a brightly colored orange and have distinctive bands across their backs which may be lost as they mature. Their nostrils are slits located farther back on their snouts (closer to the eyes than the nose), and their overall body size is dependent on the available food supply, the time of year, environmental climate, and reproductive state. Males are generally larger and more robust than females, but females have a more gentle look about them. Those differences allow males to be distinguished from females from a distance without careful inspection. Adult monitor lizards also go through periods of molting in which they shed their outer layer of skin to expand their overall body size. This process can take several months and happens around three times per year. Their skin is adapted to the desert environment where they live, and they are excellent swimmers and divers and have been known to enter the water occasionally to hunt for food.</p>\\r\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Subspecies</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t<em>Varanus griseus griseus</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe V. g. griseus subspecies (grey monitor) has five to eight narrow grey bands on its back, as well as 19-28 bands on its tail. Its tail is more rounded that those of the other subspecies, and the final size of the adult depends on which habitat they are living. Their coloration can be from simple grey (in desert-like ecosystems) to brilliantly colored (in areas with large amounts of plant growth). Their most common prey is lizards and snakes, but can also include ground-nesting birds and other small mammals.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><em>Varanus griseus caspius</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe V. g. caspius subspecies (Caspian monitor) has five to eight bands on its back, 13-19 bands on its tail, a plain tail tip, and about 143 rows of scales in the middle section of its body. It has the largest body of the three subspecies, and is considered to be in danger of becoming extinct. They are found in mainly sandy or clay environments, although sporadically in sparsely woodland areas. Their diets include tortoises and their eggs, small mammals, and adult cobras and vipers. They are strong diggers and can easily build burrows that are several feet long.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><em>Varanus griseus koniecznyi</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe V. g. koniecznyi subspecies (Indian desert monitor) has three to five bands on its back, 13-19 bands on its tail, a plain tail tip, 108-139 rows of scales on its midsection, and a broader and flatter head when compared to the other subspecies. It is mainly found in Pakistan and India, and has the smallest body of the three subspecies. They have been reported to possibly not go through the normal hibernation period over the winter, but are still inactive and do not feed between December and March. Their normal diets consist mainly of invertebrates, but can also branch out to other lizards and small mammals.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Lifestyle</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tV. griseus goes into hibernation from about September to April. In April is a mass exodus from their hibernation, and they become most active between May and July. During the middle of the day, the lizards mainly stay in their burrows and only come to the desert surface to search for food. The monitor lizards require approximately three to four full hibernation periods (years) to reach their full size (about 55–65 cm excluding their tails) and at least three hibernation periods before they become sexually mature. The overall lifespan of V. griseus in the wild does not normally exceed around eight years in both males and females.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Importance of body temperature</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tV. griseus is a cold-blooded ectotherm whose behaviors therefore depend on the outside temperatures. Many lizards become sluggish in cold weather and even may become inactive if the temperature decreases substantially. Their olfactory and nerve signals significantly slow down, which severely limit the lizard from either catching potential prey or escaping from predators. The body temperature of V. griseus is directly proportional to its running speed between the temperatures of 21 and 37 °C. Between those temperatures, the running speed of the monitor lizard increases from a little over 1 m/s at 21 °C to around 3 m/s at 37 °C. Over 37 °C, its running speed does not increase, and below 21 °C, the lizards are extremely sluggish. If they are being pursued by a predator while their body temperature is less than 21 °C, they will not flee, but will instead hold their ground and become extremely aggressive. The body temperature of V. griseus depends mainly on the outside environment (time of day, season, etc.). Their internal temperatures begin warming up before they even leave their burrows through conductive heat gain, and their temperatures rapidly rise once they begin basking in the morning sun and reach their highest point in the noonday heat. The specific body temperature of V. griseus can vary depending on the average temperatures of the country they live in, but their maximum body temperature does not usually exceed 38.5 °C even when basking in the sunlight. Male monitor lizards are generally more active and have a higher average body temperature than the females. The body temperature of the lizard during hibernation is 15.0 to 30.5 °C, but in many areas, the average body temperature during hibernation is around 16-18 °C.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Reproduction</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tDesert monitor reproduction normally takes place between May and July. Copulation occurs in May and June, and the lizards normally lay their eggs from the latter part of June through the beginning of July. The eggs are incubated at temperatures from 29 to 31 °C, and hatch after an average of 120 days. At birth, the baby lizards have a total length of around 25 cm.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Feeding, hunting, and diet</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tLike most members of the genus Varanus, V. griseus is a carnivore. The preferred prey of the species is mice, eggs, or fish, but it will also prey on smaller mammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians, insects, or other invertebrates, if the opportunity presents itself.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Venom</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe possibility of venom in the genus Varanus is widely debated. Previously, venom was thought to be unique to Serpentes (snakes) and Heloderma (venomous lizards). The aftereffects of a Varanus bite were thought to be due to oral bacteria alone, but recent studies have shown venom glands are more likely in the mouths of several, if not all of the species. V. griseus has not yet been specifically tested, but its bites have shown aftereffects consistent with the venomous bites from other varanid lizards. The venom can be used as a defensive mechanism to fend off predators, to help digest food, to sustain oral hygiene, and possibly to help in capturing and killing prey.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Conservation</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tV. griseus is not threatened in much of its habitat, although a great deal of the land previously inhabited by the subspecies V. g. caspius has been turned into farmland, which puts pressure on the species. Around 17,000 skins of this lizard are involved in commercial trade every year. While trading the skins internationally is prohibited by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), in northern Africa, central Asia, and parts of India, the species is unprotected from hunting laws and is still hunted commercially.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Captivity</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThese lizards rarely do well and, at most, live only a few years in captivity. On occasion, when their living requirements can be specifically met, they have been documented to live for more than 17 years, although they never become docile, and never become accustomed to being handled. In captivity, their environments should mirror those of many ground-dwelling animals, as well as their natural desert habitat.

            \'safe_value\' => "<p>Varanus griseus monitor lizards normally display a variety of body coloration from light brown and yellow to grey. They average about one meter in length, but can reach total body lengths of almost two meters. These lizards can also have horizontal bands on either their backs or tails, along with yellow spots across their backs. Their young are normally a brightly colored orange and have distinctive bands across their backs which may be lost as they mature. Their nostrils are slits located farther back on their snouts (closer to the eyes than the nose), and their overall body size is dependent on the available food supply, the time of year, environmental climate, and reproductive state. Males are generally larger and more robust than females, but females have a more gentle look about them. Those differences allow males to be distinguished from females from a distance without careful inspection. Adult monitor lizards also go through periods of molting in which they shed their outer layer of skin to expand their overall body size. This process can take several months and happens around three times per year. Their skin is adapted to the desert environment where they live, and they are excellent swimmers and divers and have been known to enter the water occasionally to hunt for food.</p>\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\n<p><u>Subspecies</u><br />\\n\\t\\t<em>Varanus griseus griseus</em><br />\\n\\t\\tThe V. g. griseus subspecies (grey monitor) has five to eight narrow grey bands on its back, as well as 19-28 bands on its tail.

Their coloration can be from simple grey (in desert-like ecosystems) to brilliantly colored (in areas with large amounts of plant growth).

Janet Mills nominated her to head the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, that the question on everyone’s lips at her legislative confirmation hearing Wednesday will go something like this:</p>\\n<p>“Would the acting commissioner please articulate, both for the committee’s peace of mind and that of the people of Maine, what’s going to happen to the hawk?”</p>\\n<p>Camuso admitted in an interview Friday that she doesn’t yet know the answer. But, she conceded with a laugh, “I’m going to have to have one that’s acceptable.”</p>\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\n<p>Maine’s one and only great black hawk, currently in the protective custody of the bird whisperers at Avian Haven (<a href=\\"http://www.avianhaven.org\\">www.avianhaven.org</a>), a rehabilitation hospital for all things feathered in the central Maine town of Freedom, has taken our winter lassitude by storm.</p>\\n<p>While its ever-growing multitude of fans waited breathlessly for the next update on Avian Haven’s Facebook page – Is it only one toe that’s frostbitten? Is it still eating its mouse “medallions”? – the young raptor continued to improve after almost freezing to death last Sunday in Portland’s Deering Oaks.</p>\\n<p>To recap: The hawk wandered away from its normal habitat in Mexico and Latin America last spring, flying first to Texas and then, during the summer, all the way to Maine.</p>\\n<p>Its arrival in August thrilled birders far and wide, the vast majority of whom had never before laid eyes on such a specimen. They flocked to its every sighting, cameras and binoculars in hand, until a winter storm knocked the bird from its perch in Deering Oaks and a cadre of heroic souls came to the rescue.</p>\\n<p>Enter Avian Haven, which for the past 20 years has treated some 26,000 birds from more than 100 species who arrive sick, orphaned, injured or any combination thereof.</p>\\n<p>“This afternoon, when (co-founder Marc Payne) opened the door of the Great Black Hawk’s hospital cage to replace provisions, the feisty bird jumped out and flew around the infirmary, landing on the exam table in the medical area,” read Thursday’s Facebook update. “So his afternoon check-up took place a little earlier than we had planned.”</p>\\n<p>Among the 150-plus comments that quickly piled up: “Is it too early to know what the chances are that you will be able to release him? If he can be released, will you do it up here or down in the warmer climate?”</p>\\n<p>The short answer is yes, it’s too soon to tell what effect the hawk’s frostbitten feet will have on its future travel plans. Once that’s known, according to Avian Haven, the decision on what to do next will be made in consultation with the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife.</p>\\n<p>Which, sooner or later, will put the new commissioner squarely on the hot seat.

            \'value\' => "<p>Females are called vixens, and young cubs are known as kits. Although the Arctic fox has a small native population in northern Scandinavia, while the corsac fox\'s range extends into European Russia, the red fox is the only fox native to Western Europe, and so is simply called \\"the fox\\" in colloquial British English. The word \\"fox\\" comes from Old English, which derived from Proto-Germanic *fuhsaz. Compare with West Frisian foks, Dutch vos, and German Fuchs. This, in turn, derives from Proto-Indo-European *puḱ- \'thick-haired; tail\'. Compare to the Hindi pū̃ch \'tail\', Tocharian B päkā \'tail; chowrie\', and Lithuanian paustìs \'fur\'. The bushy tail also forms the basis for the fox\'s Welsh name, llwynog, literally \'bushy\', from llwyn \'bush\'. Likewise, Portuguese: raposa from rabo \'tail\', Lithuanian uodẽgis from uodegà \'tail\', and Ojibwa waagosh from waa, which refers to the up and down \\"bounce\\" or flickering of an animal or its tail. The scientific term vulpes derives from the Latin word for fox, and gives the adjectives vulpine and vulpecular.</p>\\r\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Evolution</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe red fox is considered a more specialised form of Vulpes than the Afghan, corsac and Bengal foxes in the direction of size and adaptation to carnivory; the skull displays much fewer neotenous traits than in other species, and its facial area is more developed. It is, however, not as adapted for a purely carnivorous diet as the Tibetan fox.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Description</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe red fox has an elongated body and relatively short limbs. The tail, which is longer than half the body length (70 per cent of head and body length), is fluffy and reaches the ground when in a standing position. Their pupils are oval and vertically oriented. Nictitating membranes are present, but move only when the eyes are closed. The forepaws have five digits, while the hind feet have only four and lack dewclaws. They are very agile, being capable of jumping over 2-metre-high (6 ft 7 in) fences, and swim well. Vixens normally have four pairs of teats, though vixens with seven, nine, or ten teats are not uncommon. The testes of males are smaller than those of Arctic foxes. Their skulls are fairly narrow and elongated, with small braincases. Their canine teeth are relatively long. Sexual dimorphism of the skull is more pronounced than in corsac foxes, with female red foxes tending to have smaller skulls than males, with wider nasal regions and hard palates, as well as having larger canines. Their skulls are distinguished from those of dogs by their narrower muzzles, less crowded premolars, more slender canine teeth, and concave rather than convex profiles.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Dimensions</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tRed foxes are the largest species of the genus Vulpes. However, relative to dimensions, red foxes are much lighter than similarly sized dogs of the genus Canis. Their limb bones, for example, weigh 30 percent less per unit area of bone than expected for similarly sized dogs. They display significant individual, sexual, age and geographical variation in size. On average, adults measure 35–50 cm (14–20 in) high at the shoulder and 45–90 cm (18–35 in) in body length with tails measuring 30–55.5 cm (11.8–21.9 in). The ears measure 7.7–12.5 cm (3–5 in) and the hind feet 12–18.5 cm (5–7 in). Weights range from 2.2–14 kg (5–31 lb), with vixens typically weighing 15–20% less than males. Adult red foxes have skulls measuring 129–167 mm (5.1–6.6 in), while those of vixens measure 128–159 mm (5.0–6.3 in). The forefoot print measures 60 mm (2.4 in) in length and 45 mm (1.8 in) in width, while the hind foot print measures 55 mm (2.2 in) long and 38 mm (1.5 in) wide. They trot at a speed of 6–13 km/h (4–8 mph), and have a maximum running speed of 50 km/h (30 mph). They have a stride of 25–35 cm (9.8–13.8 in) when walking at a normal pace. North American red foxes are generally lightly built, with comparatively long bodies for their mass and have a high degree of sexual dimorphism. British red foxes are heavily built, but short, while continental European red foxes are closer to the general average among red fox populations. The largest red fox on record in Great Britain was a 17.2 kg (38 lb), 1.4-metre (4 ft 7 in) long male, killed in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, in early 2012.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Fur</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe winter fur is dense, soft, silky and relatively long. For the northern foxes, the fur is very long, dense and fluffy, but is shorter, sparser and coarser in southern forms. Among northern foxes, the North American varieties generally have the silkiest guard hairs, while most Eurasian red foxes have coarser fur. There are three main colour morphs; red, silver/black and cross. In the typical red morph, their coats are generally bright reddish-rusty with yellowish tints. A stripe of weak, diffuse patterns of many brown-reddish-chestnut hairs occurs along the spine. Two additional stripes pass down the shoulder blades, which, together with the spinal stripe, form a cross. The lower back is often a mottled silvery colour. The flanks are lighter coloured than the back, while the chin, lower lips, throat and front of the chest are white. The remaining lower surface of the body is dark, brown or reddish. During lactation, the belly fur of vixens may turn brick red. The upper parts of the limbs are rusty reddish, while the paws are black. The frontal part of the face and upper neck is bright brownish-rusty red, while the upper lips are white. The backs of the ears are black or brownish-reddish, while the inner surface is whitish. The top of the tail is brownish-reddish, but lighter in color than the back and flanks. The underside of the tail is pale grey with a straw-colored tint. A black spot, the location of the supracaudal gland, is usually present at the base of the tail. The tip of the tail is white.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Senses</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tRed foxes have binocular vision, but their sight reacts mainly to movement. Their auditory perception is acute, being able to hear black grouse changing roosts at 600 paces, the flight of crows at 0.25–0.5 kilometers (0.16–0.31 mi) and the squeaking of mice at about 100 meters (330 ft). They are capable of locating sounds to within one degree at 700–3,000 Hz, though less accurately at higher frequencies. Their sense of smell is good, but weaker than that of specialized dogs.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Scent glands</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tRed foxes have a pair of anal sacs lined by sebaceous glands, both of which open through a single duct. The anal sacs act as fermentation chambers in which aerobic and anaerobic bacteria convert sebum into odorous compounds, including aliphatic acids. The oval-shaped caudal gland is 25 mm (1.0 in) long and 13 mm (0.51 in) wide, and reportedly smells of violets. The presence of foot glands is equivocal. The interdigital cavities are deep, with a reddish tinge and smell strongly. Sebaceous glands are present on the angle of the jaw and mandible.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Behavior</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t<em>Social and territorial behavior</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tRed foxes either establish stable home ranges within particular areas or are itinerant with no fixed abode. They use their urine to mark their territories. A male fox raises one hind leg and his urine is sprayed forward in front of him, whereas a female fox squats down so that the urine is sprayed in the ground between the hind legs. Urine is also used to mark empty cache sites, used to store found food, as reminders not to waste time investigating them. The use of up to 12 different urination postures allows them to precisely control the position of the scent mark. Red foxes live in family groups sharing a joint territory. In favorable habitats and/or areas with low hunting pressure, subordinate foxes may be present in a range. Subordinate foxes may number one or two, sometimes up to eight in one territory. These subordinates could be formerly dominant animals, but are mostly young from the previous year, who act as helpers in rearing the breeding vixen\'s kits. Alternatively, their presence has been explained as being in response to temporary surpluses of food unrelated to assisting reproductive success. Non-breeding vixens will guard, play, groom, provision and retrieve kits, an example of kin selection. Red foxes may leave their families once they reach adulthood if the chances of winning a territory of their own are high. If not, they will stay with their parents, at the cost of postponing their own reproduction.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><em>Reproduction and development</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tRed foxes reproduce once a year in spring. Two months prior to oestrus (typically December), the reproductive organs of vixens change shape and size. By the time they enter their oestrus period, their uterine horns double in size, and their ovaries grow 1.5–2 times larger. Sperm formation in males begins in August–September, with the testicles attaining their greatest weight in December–February. The vixen\'s oestrus period lasts three weeks, during which the dog-foxes mate with the vixens for several days, often in burrows. The male\'s bulbus glandis enlarges during copulation, forming a copulatory tie which may last for more than an hour. The gestation period lasts 49–58 days. Though foxes are largely monogamous, DNA evidence from one population indicated large levels of polygyny, incest and mixed paternity litters. Subordinate vixens may become pregnant, but usually fail to whelp, or have their kits killed postpartum by either the dominant female or other subordinates. The average litter size consists of four to six kits, though litters of up to 13 kits have occurred. Large litters are typical in areas where fox mortality is high. Kits are born blind, deaf and toothless, with dark brown fluffy fur. At birth, they weigh 56–110 g (2.0–3.9 oz) and measure 14.5 cm (5.7 in) in body length and 7.5 cm (3.0 in) in tail length. At birth, they are short-legged, large-headed and have broad chests. Mothers remain with the kits for 2–3 weeks, as they are unable to thermoregulate. During this period, the fathers or barren vixens feed the mothers. Vixens are very protective of their kits, and have been known to even fight off terriers in their defense. If the mother dies before the kits are independent, the father takes over as their provider. The kits\' eyes open after 13–15 days, during which time their ear canals open and their upper teeth erupt, with the lower teeth emerging 3–4 days later. Their eyes are initially blue, but change to amber at 4–5 weeks. Coat color begins to change at three weeks of age, when the black eye streak appears. By one month, red and white patches are apparent on their faces. During this time, their ears erect and their muzzles elongate. Kits begin to leave their dens and experiment with solid food brought by their parents at the age of 3–4 weeks. The lactation period lasts 6–7 weeks. Their woolly coats begin to be coated by shiny guard hairs after 8 weeks. By the age of 3–4 months, the kits are long-legged, narrow-chested and sinewy. They reach adult proportions at the age of 6–7 months. Some vixens may reach sexual maturity at the age of 9–10 months, thus bearing their first litters at one year of age. In captivity, their longevity can be as long as 15 years, though in the wild they typically do not survive past 5 years of age.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><em>Denning behavior</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tOutside the breeding season, most red foxes favor living in the open, in densely vegetated areas, though they may enter burrows to escape bad weather. Their burrows are often dug on hill or mountain slopes, ravines, bluffs, steep banks of water bodies, ditches, depressions, gutters, in rock clefts and neglected human environments. Red foxes prefer to dig their burrows on well drained soils. Dens built among tree roots can last for decades, while those dug on the steppes last only several years. They may permanently abandon their dens during mange outbreaks, possibly as a defense mechanism against the spread of disease. In the Eurasian desert regions, foxes may use the burrows of wolves, porcupines and other large mammals, as well as those dug by gerbil colonies. Compared to burrows constructed by Arctic foxes, badgers, marmots and corsac foxes, red fox dens are not overly complex. Red fox burrows are divided into a den and temporary burrows, which consist only of a small passage or cave for concealment. The main entrance of the burrow leads downwards (40–45°) and broadens into a den, from which numerous side tunnels branch. Burrow depth ranges from 0.5–2.5 metres (1 ft 8 in–8 ft 2 in), rarely extending to ground water. The main passage can reach 17 m (56 ft) in length, standing an average of 5–7 m (16–23 ft). In spring, red foxes clear their dens of excess soil through rapid movements, first with the forepaws then with kicking motions with their hind legs, throwing the discarded soil over 2 m (6 ft 7 in) from the burrow. When kits are born, the discarded debris is trampled, thus forming a spot where the kits can play and receive food. They may share their dens with woodchucks or badgers. Unlike badgers, which fastidiously clean their earths and defecate in latrines, red foxes habitually leave pieces of prey around their dens. The average sleep time of a captive red fox is 9.8 hours per day.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Communication</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t<em>Body language</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tRed fox body language consists of movements of the ears, tail and postures, with their body markings emphasizing certain gestures. Postures can be divided into aggressive/dominant and fearful/submissive categories. Some postures may blend the two together. A pair of Wasatch mountain foxes (V. v. macroura) squabbling Inquisitive foxes will rotate and flick their ears whilst sniffing. Playful individuals will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, and raise their tails in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails back and forth with their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, the posture is similar, but without arching the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles reach up in greeting. When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other sideways and push against each other\'s flanks, betraying a mixture of fear and aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than sideways, with their tails aloft and their ears rotated sideways. During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other\'s upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats. Such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults of the same sex.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><em>Vocalizations</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tRed foxes have a wide vocal range, and produce different sounds spanning five octaves, which grade into each other. Recent analyses identify 12 different sounds produced by adults and 8 by kits. The majority of sounds can be divided into \\"contact\\" and \\"interaction\\" calls. The former vary according to the distance between individuals, while the latter vary according to the level of aggression.</p>\\r\\n\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tContact calls: The most commonly heard contact call is a three to five syllable barking \\"wow wow wow\\" sound, which is often made by two foxes approaching one another. This call is most frequently heard from December to February (when they can be confused with the territorial calls of tawny owls). The \\"wow wow wow\\" call varies according to individual; captive foxes have been recorded to answer pre-recorded calls of their pen-mates, but not those of strangers. Kits begin emitting the \\"wow wow wow\\" call at the age of 19 days, when craving attention. When red foxes draw close together, they emit trisyllabic greeting warbles similar to the clucking of chickens. Adults greet their kits with gruff huffing noises.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tInteraction calls: When greeting one another, red foxes emit high pitched whines, particularly submissive animals. A submissive fox approached by a dominant animal will emit a ululating siren-like shriek. During aggressive encounters with conspecifics, they emit a throaty rattling sound, similar to a ratchet, called \\"gekkering\\". Gekkering occurs mostly during the courting season from rival males or vixens rejecting advances. Another call that does not fit into the two categories is a long, drawn out, monosyllabic \\"waaaaah\\" sound. As it is commonly heard during the breeding season, it is thought to be emitted by vixens summoning males. When danger is detected, foxes emit a monosyllabic bark. At close quarters, it is a muffled cough, while at long distances it is sharper. Kits make warbling whimpers when nursing, these calls being especially loud when they are dissatisfied.</li>\\r\\n\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Ecology</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t<em>Diet, hunting and feeding behavior</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tRed fox with coypu. Red foxes are omnivores with a highly varied diet. Research conducted in the former Soviet Union showed red foxes consuming over 300 animal species and a few dozen species of plants. They primarily feed on small rodents like voles, mice, ground squirrels, hamsters, gerbils, woodchucks, pocket gophers and deer mice. Secondary prey species include birds (with passeriformes, galliformes and waterfowl predominating), leporids, porcupines, raccoons, opossums, reptiles, insects, other invertebrates and flotsam (marine mammals, fish and echinoderms). On very rare occasions, foxes may attack young or small ungulates. They typically target mammals up to about 3.5 kg (7.7 lb) in weight, and they require 500 grams (18 oz) of food daily. Red foxes readily eat plant material, and in some areas fruit can amount to 100% of their diet in autumn. Commonly consumed fruits include blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, cherries, persimmons, mulberries, apples, plums, grapes, and acorns. Other plant material includes grasses, sedges and tubers. Red foxes are implicated in the predation of game and song birds, hares, rabbits, muskrats, and young ungulates, particularly in preserves, reserves, and hunting farms where ground nesting birds are protected and raised, as well as in poultry farms. While the popular consensus is that olfaction is very important for hunting, two studies that experimentally investigated the role of olfactory, auditory, and visual cues found that visual cues are the most important ones for hunting in red foxes and coyotes. Red foxes prefer to hunt in the early morning hours before sunrise and late evening. Although they typically forage alone, they may aggregate in resource-rich environments. When hunting mouse-like prey, they first pinpoint their prey\'s location by sound, then leap, sailing high above their quarry, steering in mid-air with their tails, before landing on target up to 5 metres (16 ft) away. They typically only feed on carrion in the late evening hours and at night. They are extremely possessive of their food and will defend their catches from even dominant animals. Red foxes may occasionally commit acts of surplus killing; during one breeding season, four foxes were recorded to have killed around 200 black-headed gulls each, with peaks during dark, windy hours when flying conditions were unfavorable. Losses to poultry and penned game birds can be substantial because of this. Red foxes seem to dislike the taste of moles but will nonetheless catch them alive and present them to their kits as playthings. A 2008–2010 study of 84 red foxes in the Czech Republic and Germany found that successful hunting in long vegetation or under snow appeared to involve an alignment of the fox with the Earth\'s magnetic field.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><em>Enemies and competitors</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tRed foxes typically dominate other fox species. Arctic foxes generally escape competition from red foxes by living farther north, where food is too scarce to support the larger-bodied red species. Although the red species\' northern limit is linked to the availability of food, the Arctic species\' southern range is limited by the presence of the former. Red and Arctic foxes were both introduced to almost every island from the Aleutian Islands to the Alexander Archipelago during the 1830s–1930s by fur companies. The red foxes invariably displaced the Arctic foxes, with one male red fox having been reported to have killed off all resident Arctic foxes on a small island in 1866. Where they are sympatric, Arctic foxes may also escape competition by feeding on lemmings and flotsam, rather than voles, as favoured by red foxes. Both species will kill each other\'s kits, given the opportunity. Red foxes are serious competitors of corsac foxes, as they hunt the same prey all year. The red species is also stronger, is better adapted to hunting in snow deeper than 10 cm (4 in) and is more effective in hunting and catching medium to large-sized rodents. Corsac foxes seem to only outcompete red foxes in semi-desert and steppe areas. In Israel, Blanford\'s foxes escape competition with red foxes by restricting themselves to rocky cliffs and actively avoiding the open plains inhabited by red foxes. Red foxes dominate kit and swift foxes. Kit foxes usually avoid competition with their larger cousins by living in more arid environments, though red foxes have been increasing in ranges formerly occupied by kit foxes due to human-induced environmental changes. Red foxes will kill both species, and compete for food and den sites. Grey foxes are exceptional, as they dominate red foxes wherever their ranges meet. Historically, interactions between the two species were rare, as grey foxes favoured heavily wooded or semiarid habitats as opposed to the open and mesic ones preferred by red foxes. However, interactions have become more frequent due to deforestation allowing red foxes to colonise grey fox-inhabited areas. Wolves may kill and eat red foxes in disputes over carcasses. In areas in North America where red fox and coyote populations are sympatric, fox ranges tend to be located outside coyote territories. The principal cause of this separation is believed to be active avoidance of coyotes by the foxes. Interactions between the two species vary in nature, ranging from active antagonism to indifference. The majority of aggressive encounters are initiated by coyotes, and there are few reports of red foxes acting aggressively toward coyotes except when attacked or when their kits were approached. Foxes and coyotes have sometimes been seen feeding together. In Israel, red foxes share their habitat with golden jackals. Where their ranges meet, the two canids compete due to near identical diets. Foxes ignore jackal scents or tracks in their territories, and avoid close physical proximity with jackals themselves. In areas where jackals become very abundant, the population of foxes decreases significantly, apparently because of competitive exclusion. Red foxes dominate raccoon dogs, sometimes killing their kits or biting adults to death. Cases are known of foxes killing raccoon dogs entering their dens. Both species compete for mouse-like prey. This competition reaches a peak during early spring, when food is scarce. In Tartaria, red fox predation accounted for 11.1% of deaths among 54 raccoon dogs, and amounted to 14.3% of 186 raccoon dog deaths in north-western Russia. Red foxes may kill small mustelids like weasels, stone martens, pine martens, stoats, kolonoks, polecats and young sables. Eurasian badgers may live alongside red foxes in isolated sections of large burrows. It is possible that the two species tolerate each other out of mutualism; foxes provide badgers with food scraps, while badgers maintain the shared burrow\'s cleanliness. However, cases are known of badgers driving vixens from their dens and destroying their litters without eating them. Wolverines may kill red foxes, often while the latter are sleeping or near carrion. Foxes in turn may kill unattended young wolverines. Red foxes may compete with striped hyenas on large carcasses. Red foxes may give way to hyenas on unopened carcasses, as the latter\'s stronger jaws can easily tear open flesh that is too tough for foxes. Foxes may harass hyenas, using their smaller size and greater speed to avoid the hyena\'s attacks. Sometimes, foxes seem to deliberately torment hyenas even when there is no food at stake. Some foxes may mistime their attacks, and are killed. Fox remains are often found in hyena dens, and hyenas may steal foxes from traps. In Eurasia, red foxes may be preyed upon by leopards, caracals and Eurasian lynxes. The lynxes chase red foxes into deep snow, where their longer legs and larger paws give them an advantage over foxes, especially when the depth of the snow exceeds one metre. In the Velikoluki district in Russia, red foxes are absent or are seen only occasionally where lynxes establish permanent territories. Researchers consider lynxes to represent considerably less danger to red foxes than wolves do. North American felid predators of red foxes include cougars, Canadian lynxes and bobcats. Occasionally, large raptors such as Eurasian eagle owls will prey on young foxes, while golden eagles have been known to kill adults.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Range</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tRed foxes are wide-ranging animals, whose range covers nearly 70 million km2 (27 million sq mi). They are distributed across the entire Northern Hemisphere from the Arctic Circle to North Africa, Central America, and Asia. They are absent in Iceland, the Arctic islands, some parts of Siberia, and in extreme deserts. Red foxes are not present in New Zealand and are classed as a \\"prohibited new organism\\" under the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996, preventing them from being imported.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Australia</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tIn Australia, 2012 estimates indicate that there are more than 7.2 million red foxes with a range extending throughout most of the continental mainland. The species became established in Australia through successive introductions by settlers in 1830s in the British colonies of Van Diemen\'s Land (as early as 1833) and the Port Phillip District of New South Wales (as early as 1845) for the purpose of the traditional English sport of fox hunting. A permanent fox population was not established on the island of Tasmania and it is widely held that they were outcompeted by the Tasmanian devil. On the mainland, however, the species was successful as an apex predator. It is generally less common in areas where the dingo is more prevalent, however it has, primarily through its burrowing behaviour, achieved niche differentiation with both the feral dog and the feral cat. As such it has become one of the continent\'s most invasive species. The red fox has been implicated in the extinction and decline of several native Australian species, particularly those of the family Potoroidae including the desert rat-kangaroo. The spread of red foxes across the southern part of the continent has coincided with the spread of rabbits in Australia and corresponds with declines in the distribution of several medium-sized ground-dwelling mammals, including brush-tailed bettongs, burrowing bettongs, rufous bettongs, bilbys, numbats, bridled nailtail wallabys and quokkas. Most of these species are now limited to areas (such as islands) where red foxes are absent or rare. Local eradication programs exist, although eradication has proven difficult due to the denning behaviour and nocturnal hunting, so the focus is on management with the introduction of state bounties. According to the Tasmanian government, red foxes were introduced to the previously fox-free island of Tasmania in 1999 or 2000, posing a significant threat to native wildlife including the eastern bettong, and an eradication program conducted by the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries and Water has been established.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Sardinia</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe origin of the Sardinian ichnusae subspecies is uncertain, as it is absent from Pleistocene deposits in their current homeland. It is possible it originated during the Neolithic following its introduction to the island by humans. It is likely then that Sardinian fox populations stem from repeated introductions of animals from different localities in the Mediterranean. This latter theory may explain the subspecies\' phenotypic diversity.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Diseases and parasites</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tRed foxes are the most important rabies vector in Europe. In London, arthritis is not uncommon in foxes, being particularly frequent in the spine. Foxes may be infected with leptospirosis and tularemia, though they are not overly susceptible to the latter. They may also fall ill from listeriosis and spirochetosis, as well as acting as vectors in spreading erysipelas, brucellosis and tick-borne encephalitis. A mysterious fatal disease near Lake Sartlan in the Novosibirsk Oblast was noted among local red foxes, but the cause was undetermined. The possibility was considered that it was caused by an acute form of encephalomyelitis, which was first observed in captive bred silver foxes. Individual cases of foxes infected with Yersinia pestis are known. Red foxes are not readily prone to infestation with fleas. Species like Spilopsyllus cuniculi are probably only caught from the fox\'s prey species, while others like Archaeopsylla erinacei are caught whilst travelling. Fleas that feed on red foxes include Pulex irritans, Ctenocephalides canis and Paraceras melis. Ticks such as Ixodes ricinus and I. hexagonus are not uncommon in foxes, and are typically found on nursing vixens and kits still in their earths. The louse Trichodectes vulpis specifically targets foxes, but is found infrequently. The mite Sarcoptes scabiei is the most important cause of mange in red foxes. It causes extensive hair loss, starting from the base of the tail and hindfeet, then the rump before moving on to the rest of the body. In the final stages of the condition, foxes can lose most of their fur, 50% of their body weight and may gnaw at infected extremities. In the epizootic phase of the disease, it usually takes foxes four months to die after infection. Other endoparasites include Demodex folliculorum, Notoderes, Otodectes cynotis (which is frequently found in the ear canal), Linguatula serrata (which infects the nasal passages) and ringworms. Up to 60 helminth species are known to infect foxes in fur farms, while 20 are known in the wild. Several coccidian species of the genera Isospora and Eimeria are also known to infect them. The most common nematode species found in fox guts are Toxocara canis and Uncinaria stenocephala, Capillaria aerophila and Crenosoma vulpis, the latter two infect their lungs. Capillaria plica infect the fox\'s bladder. Trichinella spiralis rarely affects them. The most common tapeworm species in foxes are Taenia spiralis and T. pisiformis. Others include Echinococcus granulosus and E. multilocularis. Eleven trematode species infect red foxes, including Metorchis conjunctus.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Relationships with humans</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t<em>In folklore and mythology</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tRed foxes feature prominently in the folklore and mythology of human cultures with which they are sympatric. In Greek mythology, the Teumessian fox or Cadmean vixen, was a gigantic fox that was destined never to be caught. The fox was one of the children of Echidna. In Celtic mythology, the red fox is a symbolic animal. In the Cotswolds, witches were thought to take the shape of foxes to steal butter from their neighbours. In later European folklore, the figure of Reynard the Fox symbolises trickery and deceit. He originally appeared (then under the name of \\"Reinardus\\") as a secondary character in the 1150 poem \\"Ysengrimus\\". He reappeared in 1175 in Pierre Saint Cloud\'s Le Roman de Renart, and made his debut in England in Geoffrey Chaucer\'s The Nun\'s Priest\'s Tale. Many of Reynard\'s adventures may stem from actual observations on fox behaviour; he is an enemy of the wolf and has a fondness for blackberries and grapes. Chinese folk tales tell of fox-spirits called huli jing that may have up to nine tails, or kumiho as they are known in Korea. In Japanese mythology, the kitsune are fox-like spirits possessing magical abilities that increase with their age and wisdom. Foremost among these is the ability to assume human form. While some folktales speak of kitsune employing this ability to trick others, other stories portray them as faithful guardians, friends, lovers, and wives. In Arab folklore, the fox is considered a cowardly, weak, deceitful, and cunning animal, said to feign death by filling its abdomen with air to appear bloated, then lies on its side, awaiting the approach of unwitting prey. The animal\'s cunning was noted by the authors of the Bible, and applied the word \\"fox\\" to false prophets (Ezekiel 13:4) and the hypocrisy of Herod Antipas (Luke 13:32). The cunning Fox is commonly found in Native American mythology, where it is portrayed as an almost constant companion to Coyote. Fox, however, is a deceitful companion that often steals Coyote\'s food. In the Achomawi creation myth, Fox and Coyote are the co-creators of the world, that leave just before the arrival of humans. The Yurok tribe believed that Fox, in anger, captured the sun, and tied him to a hill, causing him to burn a great hole in the ground. An Inuit story tells of how Fox, portrayed as a beautiful woman, tricks a hunter into marrying her, only to resume her true form and leave after he offends her. A Menominee story tells of how Fox is an untrustworthy friend to the Wolf.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><em>Hunting</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe earliest historical records of fox hunting come from the fourth century BC; Alexander the Great is known to have hunted foxes and a seal dated from 350 BC depicts a Persian horseman in the process of spearing a fox. Xenophon, who viewed hunting as part of a cultured man\'s education, advocated the killing of foxes as pests, as they distracted hounds from hares. The Romans were hunting foxes by 80 AD. During the Dark Ages in Europe, foxes were considered secondary quarries, but gradually grew in importance. Cnut the Great reclassed foxes as Beasts of the Chase, a lower category of quarry than Beasts of Venery. Foxes were gradually hunted less as vermin and more as Beasts of the Chase, to the point that by the late 1200s, Edward I had a royal pack of foxhounds and a specialised fox huntsman. In this period, foxes were increasingly hunted above ground with hounds, rather than underground with terriers. Edward, Second Duke of York assisted the climb of foxes as more prestigious quarries in his The Master of Game. By the Renaissance, fox hunting became a traditional sport of the nobility. After the English Civil War caused a drop in deer populations, fox hunting grew in popularity. By the mid-1600s, Britain was divided into fox hunting territories, with the first fox hunting clubs being formed (the first was the Charlton Hunt Club in 1737). The popularity of fox hunting in Britain reached a peak during the 1700s. Although already native to North America, red foxes from England were imported for sporting purposes to Virginia and Maryland in 1730 by prosperous tobacco planters. These American fox hunters considered the red species more sporting than grey species.</p>\\r\\n\\t<blockquote>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>The grays furnished more fun, the reds more excitement. The grays did not run so far, but usually kept near home, going in a circuit of six or eight miles. \'An old red, generally so called irrespective of age, as a tribute to his prowess, might lead the dogs all day, and end by losing them as evening fell, after taking them a dead stretch for thirty miles. The capture of a gray was what men boasted of; a chase after \'an old red\' was what they \'yarned\' about.</p>\\r\\n\\t</blockquote>\\r\\n\\t<p>Red foxes are still widely persecuted as pests, with human-caused deaths among the highest causes of mortality in the species. Annual fox kills are: UK 21,500–25,000 (2000); Germany 600,000 (2000–2001); Austria 58,000 (2000–2001); Sweden 58,000 (1999–2000); Finland 56,000 (2000–2001); Denmark 50,000 (1976–1977); Switzerland 34,832 (2001); Norway 17,000 (2000–2001); Saskatchewan (Canada) 2,000 (2000–2001); Nova Scotia (Canada) 491 (2000–2001); Minnesota (US) 4,000–8,000 (average annual trapping harvest 2002–2009); New Mexico (US) 69 (1999–2000).</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Fur use</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tRed fox pelts Red foxes are among the most important furbearing animals harvested by the fur trade. Their pelts are used for trimmings, scarfs, muffs, jackets and coats. They are principally used as trimming for both cloth coats and fur garments, including evening wraps. The pelts of silver-morph foxes are popular as capes, while cross foxes are mostly used for scarves and rarely for trimming. The number of sold fox scarves exceeds the total number of scarves made from other furbearers. However, this amount is overshadowed by the total number of fox pelts used for trimming purposes. The silver morphs are the most valued by furriers, followed by the cross and red morphs respectively. In the early 1900s, over 1,000 American fox skins were imported to Britain annually, while 500,000 were exported annually from Germany and Russia. The total worldwide trade of wild red foxes in 1985–86 was 1,543,995 pelts. Foxes amounted to 45% of US wild-caught pelts worth $50 million. Pelt prices are increasing, with 2012 North American wholesale auction prices averaging $39, and 2013 prices averaging $65.78. North American red foxes, particularly those of northern Alaska, are the most valued for their fur, as they have guard hairs of a silky texture, which, after dressing, allow the wearer unrestricted mobility. Red foxes living in southern Alaska\'s coastal areas and the Aleutian Islands are an exception, as they have extremely coarse pelts that rarely exceed one-third of the price of their northern Alaskan cousins. Most European peltries have coarse-textured fur compared to North American varieties. The only exceptions are the Nordic and Far Eastern Russian peltries, but they are still inferior to North American peltries in terms of silkiness.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Livestock and pet predation</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tRed foxes may on occasions prey on lambs. Usually, lambs targeted by foxes tend to be physically weakened specimens, but not invariably. Lambs belonging to small breeds, such as Blackface, are more vulnerable than larger breeds such as Merino. Twins may be more vulnerable to foxes than singlets, as ewes cannot effectively defend both simultaneously. Crossbreeding small, upland ewes with larger, lowland rams can cause difficult and prolonged labour for ewes due to the heaviness of the resulting offspring, thus making the lambs more at risk to fox predation. Lambs born from gimmers (ewes breeding for the first time) are more often killed by foxes than those of experienced mothers, who stick closer to their young. Red foxes may prey on domestic rabbits and guinea pigs if they are kept in open runs or are allowed to range freely in gardens. This problem is usually averted by housing them in robust hutches and runs. Urban foxes frequently encounter cats and may feed alongside them. In physical confrontations, the cats usually have the upper hand. Authenticated cases of foxes killing cats usually involve kittens. Although most foxes do not prey on cats, some may do so, and may treat them more as competitors rather than food.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Taming and domestication</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tIn their unmodified wild state, red foxes are generally unsuitable as pets. Many supposedly abandoned kits are adopted by well-meaning people during the spring period, though it is unlikely that vixens would abandon their young. Actual orphans are rare, and the ones that are adopted are likely kits that simply strayed from their den site. Kits require almost constant supervision; when still suckling, they require milk at four-hour intervals day and night. Once weaned, they may become destructive to leather objects, furniture and electric cables.Though generally friendly toward people when young, captive red foxes become fearful of humans, save for their handlers, once they reach 10 weeks of age. They maintain their wild counterpart\'s strong instinct of concealment, and may pose a threat to domestic birds, even when well fed. Although suspicious of strangers, they can form bonds with cats and dogs, even ones bred for fox hunting. Tame foxes were once used to draw ducks close to hunting blinds. A strain of truly domesticated red foxes was introduced by Russian geneticist Dmitry Belyayev who, over a 40-year period, bred several generations of silver morph foxes on fur farms, selecting only those individuals that showed the least fear of humans. Eventually, Belyayev\'s team selected only those that showed the most positive response to humans, thus resulting in a population of foxes whose behaviour and appearance was significantly changed. After about ten generations of controlled breeding, these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. These behavioural changes were accompanied by physical alterations, which included piebald coats, floppy ears in pups, and curled tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Urban foxes</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t<em>Distribution</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tRed foxes have been exceedingly successful in colonising built-up environments, especially lower-density suburbs, although many have also been sighted in dense urban areas far from the countryside. Throughout the twentieth century, they established themselves in many Australian, European, Japanese, and North American cities. The species first colonised British cities during the 1930s, entering Bristol and London during the 1940s, and later established themselves in Cambridge and Norwich. In Australia, red foxes were recorded in Melbourne as early as the 1930s, while in Zurich, Switzerland, they only starting appearing in the 1980s. Urban red foxes are most common in residential suburbs consisting of privately owned, low-density housing. They are rare in areas where industry, commerce or council-rented houses predominate. In these latter areas, the distribution is of a lower average density because they rely less on human resources; the home range of these foxes average from 80–90 hectares (200–220 acres), whereas those in more residential areas average from 25–40 hectares (60–100 acres). In 2006 it was estimated that there were 10,000 foxes in London. City-dwelling foxes may have the potential to consistently grow larger than their rural counterparts, as a result of abundant scraps and a relative dearth of predators. In cities foxes may scavenge food from litter bins and bin bags, although much of their diet will be similar to rural foxes.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><em>Behavior</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tUrban red foxes are most active at dusk and dawn, doing most of their hunting and scavenging at these times. It is uncommon to spot them during the day, but they can be caught sunbathing on roofs of houses or sheds. Foxes will often make their homes in hidden and undisturbed spots in urban areas as well as on the edges of a city, visiting at night for sustenance. While foxes will scavenge successfully in the city (and the foxes tend to eat anything that the humans eat) some urban residents will deliberately leave food out for the animals, finding them endearing. Doing this regularly can attract foxes to one\'s home; they can become accustomed to human presence, warming up to their providers by allowing themselves to be approached and in some cases even played with, particularly young cubs.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><em>Urban fox control</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tUrban foxes can cause problems for local residents. Foxes have been known to steal chickens, disrupt rubbish bins and damage gardens. Most complaints about urban foxes made to local authorities occur during the breeding season in late January/early February or from late April to August, when the new cubs are developing. In the UK, hunting foxes in urban areas is banned, and shooting them in an urban environment is not suitable. One alternative to hunting urban foxes has been to trap them, which appears to be a more viable method. However, killing foxes has little effect on the population in an urban area; those that are killed are very soon replaced, either by new cubs during the breeding season or by other foxes moving into the territory of those that were killed. A more effective method of fox control is to deter them from the specific areas they inhabit. Deterrents such as creosote, diesel oil, or ammonia can be used. Cleaning up and blocking access to den locations can also discourage a fox\'s return.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><em>Relationship between urban and rural foxes</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tIn January 2014 it was reported that \\"Fleet\\", a relatively tame urban fox tracked as part of a wider study by the University of Brighton in partnership with the BBC\'s Winterwatch, had unexpectedly travelled 195 miles in 21 days from his neighbourhood in Hove, at the western edge of East Sussex, across rural countryside as far as Rye, at the eastern edge of the county. He was still continuing his journey when the GPS collar stopped transmitting, due to suspected water damage. Along with setting a record for the longest journey undertaken by a tracked fox in the United Kingdom, his travels have highlighted the fluidity of movement between rural and urban fox populations.</p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n",

            \'safe_value\' => "<p>Females are called vixens, and young cubs are known as kits. Although the Arctic fox has a small native population in northern Scandinavia, while the corsac fox\'s range extends into European Russia, the red fox is the only fox native to Western Europe, and so is simply called \\"the fox\\" in colloquial British English. The word \\"fox\\" comes from Old English, which derived from Proto-Germanic *fuhsaz. Compare with West Frisian foks, Dutch vos, and German Fuchs. This, in turn, derives from Proto-Indo-European *puḱ- \'thick-haired; tail\'. Compare to the Hindi pū̃ch \'tail\', Tocharian B päkā \'tail; chowrie\', and Lithuanian paustìs \'fur\'. The bushy tail also forms the basis for the fox\'s Welsh name, llwynog, literally \'bushy\', from llwyn \'bush\'. Likewise, Portuguese: raposa from rabo \'tail\', Lithuanian uodẽgis from uodegà \'tail\', and Ojibwa waagosh from waa, which refers to the up and down \\"bounce\\" or flickering of an animal or its tail. The scientific term vulpes derives from the Latin word for fox, and gives the adjectives vulpine and vulpecular.</p>\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\n<p><u>Evolution</u><br />\\n\\t\\tThe red fox is considered a more specialised form of Vulpes than the Afghan, corsac and Bengal foxes in the direction of size and adaptation to carnivory; the skull displays much fewer neotenous traits than in other species, and its facial area is more developed. It is, however, not as adapted for a purely carnivorous diet as the Tibetan fox.</p>\\n<p><u>Description</u><br />\\n\\t\\tThe red fox has an elongated body and relatively short limbs. The tail, which is longer than half the body length (70 per cent of head and body length), is fluffy and reaches the ground when in a standing position. Their pupils are oval and vertically oriented. Nictitating membranes are present, but move only when the eyes are closed. The forepaws have five digits, while the hind feet have only four and lack dewclaws. They are very agile, being capable of jumping over 2-metre-high (6 ft 7 in) fences, and swim well. Vixens normally have four pairs of teats, though vixens with seven, nine, or ten teats are not uncommon. The testes of males are smaller than those of Arctic foxes. Their skulls are fairly narrow and elongated, with small braincases. Their canine teeth are relatively long. Sexual dimorphism of the skull is more pronounced than in corsac foxes, with female red foxes tending to have smaller skulls than males, with wider nasal regions and hard palates, as well as having larger canines. Their skulls are distinguished from those of dogs by their narrower muzzles, less crowded premolars, more slender canine teeth, and concave rather than convex profiles.</p>\\n<p><u>Dimensions</u><br />\\n\\t\\tRed foxes are the largest species of the genus Vulpes. However, relative to dimensions, red foxes are much lighter than similarly sized dogs of the genus Canis. Their limb bones, for example, weigh 30 percent less per unit area of bone than expected for similarly sized dogs. They display significant individual, sexual, age and geographical variation in size. On average, adults measure 35–50 cm (14–20 in) high at the shoulder and 45–90 cm (18–35 in) in body length with tails measuring 30–55.5 cm (11.8–21.9 in). The ears measure 7.7–12.5 cm (3–5 in) and the hind feet 12–18.5 cm (5–7 in). Weights range from 2.2–14 kg (5–31 lb), with vixens typically weighing 15–20% less than males. Adult red foxes have skulls measuring 129–167 mm (5.1–6.6 in), while those of vixens measure 128–159 mm (5.0–6.3 in). The forefoot print measures 60 mm (2.4 in) in length and 45 mm (1.8 in) in width, while the hind foot print measures 55 mm (2.2 in) long and 38 mm (1.5 in) wide. They trot at a speed of 6–13 km/h (4–8 mph), and have a maximum running speed of 50 km/h (30 mph). They have a stride of 25–35 cm (9.8–13.8 in) when walking at a normal pace. North American red foxes are generally lightly built, with comparatively long bodies for their mass and have a high degree of sexual dimorphism. British red foxes are heavily built, but short, while continental European red foxes are closer to the general average among red fox populations. The largest red fox on record in Great Britain was a 17.2 kg (38 lb), 1.4-metre (4 ft 7 in) long male, killed in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, in early 2012.</p>\\n<p><u>Fur</u><br />\\n\\t\\tThe winter fur is dense, soft, silky and relatively long. For the northern foxes, the fur is very long, dense and fluffy, but is shorter, sparser and coarser in southern forms. Among northern foxes, the North American varieties generally have the silkiest guard hairs, while most Eurasian red foxes have coarser fur. There are three main colour morphs; red, silver/black and cross. In the typical red morph, their coats are generally bright reddish-rusty with yellowish tints. A stripe of weak, diffuse patterns of many brown-reddish-chestnut hairs occurs along the spine. Two additional stripes pass down the shoulder blades, which, together with the spinal stripe, form a cross. The lower back is often a mottled silvery colour. The flanks are lighter coloured than the back, while the chin, lower lips, throat and front of the chest are white. The remaining lower surface of the body is dark, brown or reddish. During lactation, the belly fur of vixens may turn brick red. The upper parts of the limbs are rusty reddish, while the paws are black. The frontal part of the face and upper neck is bright brownish-rusty red, while the upper lips are white. The backs of the ears are black or brownish-reddish, while the inner surface is whitish. The top of the tail is brownish-reddish, but lighter in color than the back and flanks. The underside of the tail is pale grey with a straw-colored tint. A black spot, the location of the supracaudal gland, is usually present at the base of the tail. The tip of the tail is white.</p>\\n<p><u>Senses</u><br />\\n\\t\\tRed foxes have binocular vision, but their sight reacts mainly to movement. Their auditory perception is acute, being able to hear black grouse changing roosts at 600 paces, the flight of crows at 0.25–0.5 kilometers (0.16–0.31 mi) and the squeaking of mice at about 100 meters (330 ft). They are capable of locating sounds to within one degree at 700–3,000 Hz, though less accurately at higher frequencies. Their sense of smell is good, but weaker than that of specialized dogs.</p>\\n<p><u>Scent glands</u><br />\\n\\t\\tRed foxes have a pair of anal sacs lined by sebaceous glands, both of which open through a single duct. The anal sacs act as fermentation chambers in which aerobic and anaerobic bacteria convert sebum into odorous compounds, including aliphatic acids. The oval-shaped caudal gland is 25 mm (1.0 in) long and 13 mm (0.51 in) wide, and reportedly smells of violets. The presence of foot glands is equivocal. The interdigital cavities are deep, with a reddish tinge and smell strongly. Sebaceous glands are present on the angle of the jaw and mandible.</p>\\n<p><u>Behavior</u><br />\\n\\t\\t<em>Social and territorial behavior</em><br />\\n\\t\\tRed foxes either establish stable home ranges within particular areas or are itinerant with no fixed abode. They use their urine to mark their territories. A male fox raises one hind leg and his urine is sprayed forward in front of him, whereas a female fox squats down so that the urine is sprayed in the ground between the hind legs. Urine is also used to mark empty cache sites, used to store found food, as reminders not to waste time investigating them. The use of up to 12 different urination postures allows them to precisely control the position of the scent mark. Red foxes live in family groups sharing a joint territory. In favorable habitats and/or areas with low hunting pressure, subordinate foxes may be present in a range. Subordinate foxes may number one or two, sometimes up to eight in one territory. These subordinates could be formerly dominant animals, but are mostly young from the previous year, who act as helpers in rearing the breeding vixen\'s kits. Alternatively, their presence has been explained as being in response to temporary surpluses of food unrelated to assisting reproductive success. Non-breeding vixens will guard, play, groom, provision and retrieve kits, an example of kin selection. Red foxes may leave their families once they reach adulthood if the chances of winning a territory of their own are high. If not, they will stay with their parents, at the cost of postponing their own reproduction.</p>\\n<p><em>Reproduction and development</em><br />\\n\\t\\tRed foxes reproduce once a year in spring. Two months prior to oestrus (typically December), the reproductive organs of vixens change shape and size. By the time they enter their oestrus period, their uterine horns double in size, and their ovaries grow 1.5–2 times larger. Sperm formation in males begins in August–September, with the testicles attaining their greatest weight in December–February. The vixen\'s oestrus period lasts three weeks, during which the dog-foxes mate with the vixens for several days, often in burrows. The male\'s bulbus glandis enlarges during copulation, forming a copulatory tie which may last for more than an hour. The gestation period lasts 49–58 days. Though foxes are largely monogamous, DNA evidence from one population indicated large levels of polygyny, incest and mixed paternity litters. Subordinate vixens may become pregnant, but usually fail to whelp, or have their kits killed postpartum by either the dominant female or other subordinates. The average litter size consists of four to six kits, though litters of up to 13 kits have occurred. Large litters are typical in areas where fox mortality is high. Kits are born blind, deaf and toothless, with dark brown fluffy fur. At birth, they weigh 56–110 g (2.0–3.9 oz) and measure 14.5 cm (5.7 in) in body length and 7.5 cm (3.0 in) in tail length. At birth, they are short-legged, large-headed and have broad chests. Mothers remain with the kits for 2–3 weeks, as they are unable to thermoregulate. During this period, the fathers or barren vixens feed the mothers. Vixens are very protective of their kits, and have been known to even fight off terriers in their defense. If the mother dies before the kits are independent, the father takes over as their provider. The kits\' eyes open after 13–15 days, during which time their ear canals open and their upper teeth erupt, with the lower teeth emerging 3–4 days later. Their eyes are initially blue, but change to amber at 4–5 weeks. Coat color begins to change at three weeks of age, when the black eye streak appears. By one month, red and white patches are apparent on their faces. During this time, their ears erect and their muzzles elongate. Kits begin to leave their dens and experiment with solid food brought by their parents at the age of 3–4 weeks. The lactation period lasts 6–7 weeks. Their woolly coats begin to be coated by shiny guard hairs after 8 weeks. By the age of 3–4 months, the kits are long-legged, narrow-chested and sinewy. They reach adult proportions at the age of 6–7 months. Some vixens may reach sexual maturity at the age of 9–10 months, thus bearing their first litters at one year of age. In captivity, their longevity can be as long as 15 years, though in the wild they typically do not survive past 5 years of age.</p>\\n<p><em>Denning behavior</em><br />\\n\\t\\tOutside the breeding season, most red foxes favor living in the open, in densely vegetated areas, though they may enter burrows to escape bad weather. Their burrows are often dug on hill or mountain slopes, ravines, bluffs, steep banks of water bodies, ditches, depressions, gutters, in rock clefts and neglected human environments. Red foxes prefer to dig their burrows on well drained soils. Dens built among tree roots can last for decades, while those dug on the steppes last only several years. They may permanently abandon their dens during mange outbreaks, possibly as a defense mechanism against the spread of disease. In the Eurasian desert regions, foxes may use the burrows of wolves, porcupines and other large mammals, as well as those dug by gerbil colonies. Compared to burrows constructed by Arctic foxes, badgers, marmots and corsac foxes, red fox dens are not overly complex. Red fox burrows are divided into a den and temporary burrows, which consist only of a small passage or cave for concealment. The main entrance of the burrow leads downwards (40–45°) and broadens into a den, from which numerous side tunnels branch. Burrow depth ranges from 0.5–2.5 metres (1 ft 8 in–8 ft 2 in), rarely extending to ground water. The main passage can reach 17 m (56 ft) in length, standing an average of 5–7 m (16–23 ft). In spring, red foxes clear their dens of excess soil through rapid movements, first with the forepaws then with kicking motions with their hind legs, throwing the discarded soil over 2 m (6 ft 7 in) from the burrow. When kits are born, the discarded debris is trampled, thus forming a spot where the kits can play and receive food. They may share their dens with woodchucks or badgers. Unlike badgers, which fastidiously clean their earths and defecate in latrines, red foxes habitually leave pieces of prey around their dens. The average sleep time of a captive red fox is 9.8 hours per day.</p>\\n<p><u>Communication</u><br />\\n\\t\\t<em>Body language</em><br />\\n\\t\\tRed fox body language consists of movements of the ears, tail and postures, with their body markings emphasizing certain gestures. Postures can be divided into aggressive/dominant and fearful/submissive categories. Some postures may blend the two together. A pair of Wasatch mountain foxes (V. v. macroura) squabbling Inquisitive foxes will rotate and flick their ears whilst sniffing. Playful individuals will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, and raise their tails in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails back and forth with their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, the posture is similar, but without arching the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles reach up in greeting. When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other sideways and push against each other\'s flanks, betraying a mixture of fear and aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than sideways, with their tails aloft and their ears rotated sideways. During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other\'s upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats. Such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults of the same sex.</p>\\n<p><em>Vocalizations</em><br />\\n\\t\\tRed foxes have a wide vocal range, and produce different sounds spanning five octaves, which grade into each other. Recent analyses identify 12 different sounds produced by adults and 8 by kits. The majority of sounds can be divided into \\"contact\\" and \\"interaction\\" calls. The former vary according to the distance between individuals, while the latter vary according to the level of aggression.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n\\t\\t\\tContact calls: The most commonly heard contact call is a three to five syllable barking \\"wow wow wow\\" sound, which is often made by two foxes approaching one another. This call is most frequently heard from December to February (when they can be confused with the territorial calls of tawny owls). The \\"wow wow wow\\" call varies according to individual; captive foxes have been recorded to answer pre-recorded calls of their pen-mates, but not those of strangers. Kits begin emitting the \\"wow wow wow\\" call at the age of 19 days, when craving attention. When red foxes draw close together, they emit trisyllabic greeting warbles similar to the clucking of chickens. Adults greet their kits with gruff huffing noises.</li>\\n<li>\\n\\t\\t\\tInteraction calls: When greeting one another, red foxes emit high pitched whines, particularly submissive animals. A submissive fox approached by a dominant animal will emit a ululating siren-like shriek. During aggressive encounters with conspecifics, they emit a throaty rattling sound, similar to a ratchet, called \\"gekkering\\". Gekkering occurs mostly during the courting season from rival males or vixens rejecting advances. Another call that does not fit into the two categories is a long, drawn out, monosyllabic \\"waaaaah\\" sound. As it is commonly heard during the breeding season, it is thought to be emitted by vixens summoning males. When danger is detected, foxes emit a monosyllabic bark. At close quarters, it is a muffled cough, while at long distances it is sharper. Kits make warbling whimpers when nursing, these calls being especially loud when they are dissatisfied.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><u>Ecology</u><br />\\n\\t\\t<em>Diet, hunting and feeding behavior</em><br />\\n\\t\\tRed fox with coypu. Red foxes are omnivores with a highly varied diet. Research conducted in the former Soviet Union showed red foxes consuming over 300 animal species and a few dozen species of plants. They primarily feed on small rodents like voles, mice, ground squirrels, hamsters, gerbils, woodchucks, pocket gophers and deer mice. Secondary prey species include birds (with passeriformes, galliformes and waterfowl predominating), leporids, porcupines, raccoons, opossums, reptiles, insects, other invertebrates and flotsam (marine mammals, fish and echinoderms). On very rare occasions, foxes may attack young or small ungulates. They typically target mammals up to about 3.5 kg (7.7 lb) in weight, and they require 500 grams (18 oz) of food daily. Red foxes readily eat plant material, and in some areas fruit can amount to 100% of their diet in autumn. Commonly consumed fruits include blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, cherries, persimmons, mulberries, apples, plums, grapes, and acorns. Other plant material includes grasses, sedges and tubers. Red foxes are implicated in the predation of game and song birds, hares, rabbits, muskrats, and young ungulates, particularly in preserves, reserves, and hunting farms where ground nesting birds are protected and raised, as well as in poultry farms. While the popular consensus is that olfaction is very important for hunting, two studies that experimentally investigated the role of olfactory, auditory, and visual cues found that visual cues are the most important ones for hunting in red foxes and coyotes. Red foxes prefer to hunt in the early morning hours before sunrise and late evening. Although they typically forage alone, they may aggregate in resource-rich environments. When hunting mouse-like prey, they first pinpoint their prey\'s location by sound, then leap, sailing high above their quarry, steering in mid-air with their tails, before landing on target up to 5 metres (16 ft) away. They typically only feed on carrion in the late evening hours and at night. They are extremely possessive of their food and will defend their catches from even dominant animals. Red foxes may occasionally commit acts of surplus killing; during one breeding season, four foxes were recorded to have killed around 200 black-headed gulls each, with peaks during dark, windy hours when flying conditions were unfavorable. Losses to poultry and penned game birds can be substantial because of this. Red foxes seem to dislike the taste of moles but will nonetheless catch them alive and present them to their kits as playthings. A 2008–2010 study of 84 red foxes in the Czech Republic and Germany found that successful hunting in long vegetation or under snow appeared to involve an alignment of the fox with the Earth\'s magnetic field.</p>\\n<p><em>Enemies and competitors</em><br />\\n\\t\\tRed foxes typically dominate other fox species. Arctic foxes generally escape competition from red foxes by living farther north, where food is too scarce to support the larger-bodied red species. Although the red species\' northern limit is linked to the availability of food, the Arctic species\' southern range is limited by the presence of the former. Red and Arctic foxes were both introduced to almost every island from the Aleutian Islands to the Alexander Archipelago during the 1830s–1930s by fur companies. The red foxes invariably displaced the Arctic foxes, with one male red fox having been reported to have killed off all resident Arctic foxes on a small island in 1866. Where they are sympatric, Arctic foxes may also escape competition by feeding on lemmings and flotsam, rather than voles, as favoured by red foxes. Both species will kill each other\'s kits, given the opportunity. Red foxes are serious competitors of corsac foxes, as they hunt the same prey all year. The red species is also stronger, is better adapted to hunting in snow deeper than 10 cm (4 in) and is more effective in hunting and catching medium to large-sized rodents. Corsac foxes seem to only outcompete red foxes in semi-desert and steppe areas. In Israel, Blanford\'s foxes escape competition with red foxes by restricting themselves to rocky cliffs and actively avoiding the open plains inhabited by red foxes. Red foxes dominate kit and swift foxes. Kit foxes usually avoid competition with their larger cousins by living in more arid environments, though red foxes have been increasing in ranges formerly occupied by kit foxes due to human-induced environmental changes. Red foxes will kill both species, and compete for food and den sites. Grey foxes are exceptional, as they dominate red foxes wherever their ranges meet. Historically, interactions between the two species were rare, as grey foxes favoured heavily wooded or semiarid habitats as opposed to the open and mesic ones preferred by red foxes. However, interactions have become more frequent due to deforestation allowing red foxes to colonise grey fox-inhabited areas. Wolves may kill and eat red foxes in disputes over carcasses. In areas in North America where red fox and coyote populations are sympatric, fox ranges tend to be located outside coyote territories. The principal cause of this separation is believed to be active avoidance of coyotes by the foxes. Interactions between the two species vary in nature, ranging from active antagonism to indifference. The majority of aggressive encounters are initiated by coyotes, and there are few reports of red foxes acting aggressively toward coyotes except when attacked or when their kits were approached. Foxes and coyotes have sometimes been seen feeding together. In Israel, red foxes share their habitat with golden jackals. Where their ranges meet, the two canids compete due to near identical diets. Foxes ignore jackal scents or tracks in their territories, and avoid close physical proximity with jackals themselves. In areas where jackals become very abundant, the population of foxes decreases significantly, apparently because of competitive exclusion. Red foxes dominate raccoon dogs, sometimes killing their kits or biting adults to death. Cases are known of foxes killing raccoon dogs entering their dens. Both species compete for mouse-like prey. This competition reaches a peak during early spring, when food is scarce. In Tartaria, red fox predation accounted for 11.1% of deaths among 54 raccoon dogs, and amounted to 14.3% of 186 raccoon dog deaths in north-western Russia. Red foxes may kill small mustelids like weasels, stone martens, pine martens, stoats, kolonoks, polecats and young sables. Eurasian badgers may live alongside red foxes in isolated sections of large burrows. It is possible that the two species tolerate each other out of mutualism; foxes provide badgers with food scraps, while badgers maintain the shared burrow\'s cleanliness. However, cases are known of badgers driving vixens from their dens and destroying their litters without eating them. Wolverines may kill red foxes, often while the latter are sleeping or near carrion. Foxes in turn may kill unattended young wolverines. Red foxes may compete with striped hyenas on large carcasses. Red foxes may give way to hyenas on unopened carcasses, as the latter\'s stronger jaws can easily tear open flesh that is too tough for foxes. Foxes may harass hyenas, using their smaller size and greater speed to avoid the hyena\'s attacks. Sometimes, foxes seem to deliberately torment hyenas even when there is no food at stake. Some foxes may mistime their attacks, and are killed. Fox remains are often found in hyena dens, and hyenas may steal foxes from traps. In Eurasia, red foxes may be preyed upon by leopards, caracals and Eurasian lynxes. The lynxes chase red foxes into deep snow, where their longer legs and larger paws give them an advantage over foxes, especially when the depth of the snow exceeds one metre. In the Velikoluki district in Russia, red foxes are absent or are seen only occasionally where lynxes establish permanent territories. Researchers consider lynxes to represent considerably less danger to red foxes than wolves do. North American felid predators of red foxes include cougars, Canadian lynxes and bobcats. Occasionally, large raptors such as Eurasian eagle owls will prey on young foxes, while golden eagles have been known to kill adults.</p>\\n<p><u>Range</u><br />\\n\\t\\tRed foxes are wide-ranging animals, whose range covers nearly 70 million km2 (27 million sq mi). They are distributed across the entire Northern Hemisphere from the Arctic Circle to North Africa, Central America, and Asia. They are absent in Iceland, the Arctic islands, some parts of Siberia, and in extreme deserts. Red foxes are not present in New Zealand and are classed as a \\"prohibited new organism\\" under the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996, preventing them from being imported.</p>\\n<p><u>Australia</u><br />\\n\\t\\tIn Australia, 2012 estimates indicate that there are more than 7.2 million red foxes with a range extending throughout most of the continental mainland. The species became established in Australia through successive introductions by settlers in 1830s in the British colonies of Van Diemen\'s Land (as early as 1833) and the Port Phillip District of New South Wales (as early as 1845) for the purpose of the traditional English sport of fox hunting. A permanent fox population was not established on the island of Tasmania and it is widely held that they were outcompeted by the Tasmanian devil. On the mainland, however, the species was successful as an apex predator. It is generally less common in areas where the dingo is more prevalent, however it has, primarily through its burrowing behaviour, achieved niche differentiation with both the feral dog and the feral cat. As such it has become one of the continent\'s most invasive species. The red fox has been implicated in the extinction and decline of several native Australian species, particularly those of the family Potoroidae including the desert rat-kangaroo. The spread of red foxes across the southern part of the continent has coincided with the spread of rabbits in Australia and corresponds with declines in the distribution of several medium-sized ground-dwelling mammals, including brush-tailed bettongs, burrowing bettongs, rufous bettongs, bilbys, numbats, bridled nailtail wallabys and quokkas. Most of these species are now limited to areas (such as islands) where red foxes are absent or rare. Local eradication programs exist, although eradication has proven difficult due to the denning behaviour and nocturnal hunting, so the focus is on management with the introduction of state bounties. According to the Tasmanian government, red foxes were introduced to the previously fox-free island of Tasmania in 1999 or 2000, posing a significant threat to native wildlife including the eastern bettong, and an eradication program conducted by the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries and Water has been established.</p>\\n<p><u>Sardinia</u><br />\\n\\t\\tThe origin of the Sardinian ichnusae subspecies is uncertain, as it is absent from Pleistocene deposits in their current homeland. It is possible it originated during the Neolithic following its introduction to the island by humans. It is likely then that Sardinian fox populations stem from repeated introductions of animals from different localities in the Mediterranean. This latter theory may explain the subspecies\' phenotypic diversity.</p>\\n<p><u>Diseases and parasites</u><br />\\n\\t\\tRed foxes are the most important rabies vector in Europe. In London, arthritis is not uncommon in foxes, being particularly frequent in the spine. Foxes may be infected with leptospirosis and tularemia, though they are not overly susceptible to the latter. They may also fall ill from listeriosis and spirochetosis, as well as acting as vectors in spreading erysipelas, brucellosis and tick-borne encephalitis. A mysterious fatal disease near Lake Sartlan in the Novosibirsk Oblast was noted among local red foxes, but the cause was undetermined. The possibility was considered that it was caused by an acute form of encephalomyelitis, which was first observed in captive bred silver foxes. Individual cases of foxes infected with Yersinia pestis are known. Red foxes are not readily prone to infestation with fleas. Species like Spilopsyllus cuniculi are probably only caught from the fox\'s prey species, while others like Archaeopsylla erinacei are caught whilst travelling. Fleas that feed on red foxes include Pulex irritans, Ctenocephalides canis and Paraceras melis. Ticks such as Ixodes ricinus and I. hexagonus are not uncommon in foxes, and are typically found on nursing vixens and kits still in their earths. The louse Trichodectes vulpis specifically targets foxes, but is found infrequently. The mite Sarcoptes scabiei is the most important cause of mange in red foxes. It causes extensive hair loss, starting from the base of the tail and hindfeet, then the rump before moving on to the rest of the body. In the final stages of the condition, foxes can lose most of their fur, 50% of their body weight and may gnaw at infected extremities. In the epizootic phase of the disease, it usually takes foxes four months to die after infection. Other endoparasites include Demodex folliculorum, Notoderes, Otodectes cynotis (which is frequently found in the ear canal), Linguatula serrata (which infects the nasal passages) and ringworms. Up to 60 helminth species are known to infect foxes in fur farms, while 20 are known in the wild. Several coccidian species of the genera Isospora and Eimeria are also known to infect them. The most common nematode species found in fox guts are Toxocara canis and Uncinaria stenocephala, Capillaria aerophila and Crenosoma vulpis, the latter two infect their lungs. Capillaria plica infect the fox\'s bladder. Trichinella spiralis rarely affects them. The most common tapeworm species in foxes are Taenia spiralis and T. pisiformis. Others include Echinococcus granulosus and E. multilocularis. Eleven trematode species infect red foxes, including Metorchis conjunctus.</p>\\n<p><u>Relationships with humans</u><br />\\n\\t\\t<em>In folklore and mythology</em><br />\\n\\t\\tRed foxes feature prominently in the folklore and mythology of human cultures with which they are sympatric. In Greek mythology, the Teumessian fox or Cadmean vixen, was a gigantic fox that was destined never to be caught. The fox was one of the children of Echidna. In Celtic mythology, the red fox is a symbolic animal. In the Cotswolds, witches were thought to take the shape of foxes to steal butter from their neighbours. In later European folklore, the figure of Reynard the Fox symbolises trickery and deceit. He originally appeared (then under the name of \\"Reinardus\\") as a secondary character in the 1150 poem \\"Ysengrimus\\". He reappeared in 1175 in Pierre Saint Cloud\'s Le Roman de Renart, and made his debut in England in Geoffrey Chaucer\'s The Nun\'s Priest\'s Tale. Many of Reynard\'s adventures may stem from actual observations on fox behaviour; he is an enemy of the wolf and has a fondness for blackberries and grapes. Chinese folk tales tell of fox-spirits called huli jing that may have up to nine tails, or kumiho as they are known in Korea. In Japanese mythology, the kitsune are fox-like spirits possessing magical abilities that increase with their age and wisdom. Foremost among these is the ability to assume human form. While some folktales speak of kitsune employing this ability to trick others, other stories portray them as faithful guardians, friends, lovers, and wives. In Arab folklore, the fox is considered a cowardly, weak, deceitful, and cunning animal, said to feign death by filling its abdomen with air to appear bloated, then lies on its side, awaiting the approach of unwitting prey. The animal\'s cunning was noted by the authors of the Bible, and applied the word \\"fox\\" to false prophets (Ezekiel 13:4) and the hypocrisy of Herod Antipas (Luke 13:32). The cunning Fox is commonly found in Native American mythology, where it is portrayed as an almost constant companion to Coyote. Fox, however, is a deceitful companion that often steals Coyote\'s food. In the Achomawi creation myth, Fox and Coyote are the co-creators of the world, that leave just before the arrival of humans. The Yurok tribe believed that Fox, in anger, captured the sun, and tied him to a hill, causing him to burn a great hole in the ground. An Inuit story tells of how Fox, portrayed as a beautiful woman, tricks a hunter into marrying her, only to resume her true form and leave after he offends her. A Menominee story tells of how Fox is an untrustworthy friend to the Wolf. </p>\\n<p><em>Hunting</em><br />\\n\\t\\tThe earliest historical records of fox hunting come from the fourth century BC; Alexander the Great is known to have hunted foxes and a seal dated from 350 BC depicts a Persian horseman in the process of spearing a fox. Xenophon, who viewed hunting as part of a cultured man\'s education, advocated the killing of foxes as pests, as they distracted hounds from hares. The Romans were hunting foxes by 80 AD. During the Dark Ages in Europe, foxes were considered secondary quarries, but gradually grew in importance. Cnut the Great reclassed foxes as Beasts of the Chase, a lower category of quarry than Beasts of Venery. Foxes were gradually hunted less as vermin and more as Beasts of the Chase, to the point that by the late 1200s, Edward I had a royal pack of foxhounds and a specialised fox huntsman. In this period, foxes were increasingly hunted above ground with hounds, rather than underground with terriers. Edward, Second Duke of York assisted the climb of foxes as more prestigious quarries in his The Master of Game. By the Renaissance, fox hunting became a traditional sport of the nobility. After the English Civil War caused a drop in deer populations, fox hunting grew in popularity. By the mid-1600s, Britain was divided into fox hunting territories, with the first fox hunting clubs being formed (the first was the Charlton Hunt Club in 1737). The popularity of fox hunting in Britain reached a peak during the 1700s. Although already native to North America, red foxes from England were imported for sporting purposes to Virginia and Maryland in 1730 by prosperous tobacco planters. These American fox hunters considered the red species more sporting than grey species.</p>\\n<blockquote><p>The grays furnished more fun, the reds more excitement. The grays did not run so far, but usually kept near home, going in a circuit of six or eight miles. \'An old red, generally so called irrespective of age, as a tribute to his prowess, might lead the dogs all day, and end by losing them as evening fell, after taking them a dead stretch for thirty miles. The capture of a gray was what men boasted of; a chase after \'an old red\' was what they \'yarned\' about.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Red foxes are still widely persecuted as pests, with human-caused deaths among the highest causes of mortality in the species. Annual fox kills are: UK 21,500–25,000 (2000); Germany 600,000 (2000–2001); Austria 58,000 (2000–2001); Sweden 58,000 (1999–2000); Finland 56,000 (2000–2001); Denmark 50,000 (1976–1977); Switzerland 34,832 (2001); Norway 17,000 (2000–2001); Saskatchewan (Canada) 2,000 (2000–2001); Nova Scotia (Canada) 491 (2000–2001); Minnesota (US) 4,000–8,000 (average annual trapping harvest 2002–2009); New Mexico (US) 69 (1999–2000).</p>\\n<p><u>Fur use</u><br />\\n\\t\\tRed fox pelts Red foxes are among the most important furbearing animals harvested by the fur trade. Their pelts are used for trimmings, scarfs, muffs, jackets and coats. They are principally used as trimming for both cloth coats and fur garments, including evening wraps. The pelts of silver-morph foxes are popular as capes, while cross foxes are mostly used for scarves and rarely for trimming. The number of sold fox scarves exceeds the total number of scarves made from other furbearers. However, this amount is overshadowed by the total number of fox pelts used for trimming purposes. The silver morphs are the most valued by furriers, followed by the cross and red morphs respectively. In the early 1900s, over 1,000 American fox skins were imported to Britain annually, while 500,000 were exported annually from Germany and Russia. The total worldwide trade of wild red foxes in 1985–86 was 1,543,995 pelts. Foxes amounted to 45% of US wild-caught pelts worth $50 million. Pelt prices are increasing, with 2012 North American wholesale auction prices averaging $39, and 2013 prices averaging $65.78. North American red foxes, particularly those of northern Alaska, are the most valued for their fur, as they have guard hairs of a silky texture, which, after dressing, allow the wearer unrestricted mobility. Red foxes living in southern Alaska\'s coastal areas and the Aleutian Islands are an exception, as they have extremely coarse pelts that rarely exceed one-third of the price of their northern Alaskan cousins. Most European peltries have coarse-textured fur compared to North American varieties. The only exceptions are the Nordic and Far Eastern Russian peltries, but they are still inferior to North American peltries in terms of silkiness.</p>\\n<p><u>Livestock and pet predation</u><br />\\n\\t\\tRed foxes may on occasions prey on lambs. Usually, lambs targeted by foxes tend to be physically weakened specimens, but not invariably. Lambs belonging to small breeds, such as Blackface, are more vulnerable than larger breeds such as Merino. Twins may be more vulnerable to foxes than singlets, as ewes cannot effectively defend both simultaneously. Crossbreeding small, upland ewes with larger, lowland rams can cause difficult and prolonged labour for ewes due to the heaviness of the resulting offspring, thus making the lambs more at risk to fox predation. Lambs born from gimmers (ewes breeding for the first time) are more often killed by foxes than those of experienced mothers, who stick closer to their young. Red foxes may prey on domestic rabbits and guinea pigs if they are kept in open runs or are allowed to range freely in gardens. This problem is usually averted by housing them in robust hutches and runs. Urban foxes frequently encounter cats and may feed alongside them. In physical confrontations, the cats usually have the upper hand. Authenticated cases of foxes killing cats usually involve kittens. Although most foxes do not prey on cats, some may do so, and may treat them more as competitors rather than food.</p>\\n<p><u>Taming and domestication</u><br />\\n\\t\\tIn their unmodified wild state, red foxes are generally unsuitable as pets. Many supposedly abandoned kits are adopted by well-meaning people during the spring period, though it is unlikely that vixens would abandon their young. Actual orphans are rare, and the ones that are adopted are likely kits that simply strayed from their den site. Kits require almost constant supervision; when still suckling, they require milk at four-hour intervals day and night. Once weaned, they may become destructive to leather objects, furniture and electric cables.Though generally friendly toward people when young, captive red foxes become fearful of humans, save for their handlers, once they reach 10 weeks of age. They maintain their wild counterpart\'s strong instinct of concealment, and may pose a threat to domestic birds, even when well fed. Although suspicious of strangers, they can form bonds with cats and dogs, even ones bred for fox hunting. Tame foxes were once used to draw ducks close to hunting blinds. A strain of truly domesticated red foxes was introduced by Russian geneticist Dmitry Belyayev who, over a 40-year period, bred several generations of silver morph foxes on fur farms, selecting only those individuals that showed the least fear of humans. Eventually, Belyayev\'s team selected only those that showed the most positive response to humans, thus resulting in a population of foxes whose behaviour and appearance was significantly changed. After about ten generations of controlled breeding, these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. These behavioural changes were accompanied by physical alterations, which included piebald coats, floppy ears in pups, and curled tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves.</p>\\n<p><u>Urban foxes</u><br />\\n\\t\\t<em>Distribution</em><br />\\n\\t\\tRed foxes have been exceedingly successful in colonising built-up environments, especially lower-density suburbs, although many have also been sighted in dense urban areas far from the countryside. Throughout the twentieth century, they established themselves in many Australian, European, Japanese, and North American cities. The species first colonised British cities during the 1930s, entering Bristol and London during the 1940s, and later established themselves in Cambridge and Norwich. In Australia, red foxes were recorded in Melbourne as early as the 1930s, while in Zurich, Switzerland, they only starting appearing in the 1980s. Urban red foxes are most common in residential suburbs consisting of privately owned, low-density housing. They are rare in areas where industry, commerce or council-rented houses predominate. In these latter areas, the distribution is of a lower average density because they rely less on human resources; the home range of these foxes average from 80–90 hectares (200–220 acres), whereas those in more residential areas average from 25–40 hectares (60–100 acres). In 2006 it was estimated that there were 10,000 foxes in London. City-dwelling foxes may have the potential to consistently grow larger than their rural counterparts, as a result of abundant scraps and a relative dearth of predators. In cities foxes may scavenge food from litter bins and bin bags, although much of their diet will be similar to rural foxes.</p>\\n<p><em>Behavior</em><br />\\n\\t\\tUrban red foxes are most active at dusk and dawn, doing most of their hunting and scavenging at these times. It is uncommon to spot them during the day, but they can be caught sunbathing on roofs of houses or sheds. Foxes will often make their homes in hidden and undisturbed spots in urban areas as well as on the edges of a city, visiting at night for sustenance. While foxes will scavenge successfully in the city (and the foxes tend to eat anything that the humans eat) some urban residents will deliberately leave food out for the animals, finding them endearing. Doing this regularly can attract foxes to one\'s home; they can become accustomed to human presence, warming up to their providers by allowing themselves to be approached and in some cases even played with, particularly young cubs.</p>\\n<p><em>Urban fox control</em><br />\\n\\t\\tUrban foxes can cause problems for local residents. Foxes have been known to steal chickens, disrupt rubbish bins and damage gardens. Most complaints about urban foxes made to local authorities occur during the breeding season in late January/early February or from late April to August, when the new cubs are developing. In the UK, hunting foxes in urban areas is banned, and shooting them in an urban environment is not suitable. One alternative to hunting urban foxes has been to trap them, which appears to be a more viable method. However, killing foxes has little effect on the population in an urban area; those that are killed are very soon replaced, either by new cubs during the breeding season or by other foxes moving into the territory of those that were killed. A more effective method of fox control is to deter them from the specific areas they inhabit. Deterrents such as creosote, diesel oil, or ammonia can be used. Cleaning up and blocking access to den locations can also discourage a fox\'s return.</p>\\n<p><em>Relationship between urban and rural foxes</em><br />\\n\\t\\tIn January 2014 it was reported that \\"Fleet\\", a relatively tame urban fox tracked as part of a wider study by the University of Brighton in partnership with the BBC\'s Winterwatch, had unexpectedly travelled 195 miles in 21 days from his neighbourhood in Hove, at the western edge of East Sussex, across rural countryside as far as Rye, at the eastern edge of the county. He was still continuing his journey when the GPS collar stopped transmitting, due to suspected water damage. Along with setting a record for the longest journey undertaken by a tracked fox in the United Kingdom, his travels have highlighted the fluidity of movement between rural and urban fox populations.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p> </p>\\n",

In Yukon, Canada and the Yukon-Tanana uplands of interior Alaska, horsetail (Equisetum spp.) is important during spring and summer, comprising up to 86% of American black bear diets. Apical meristems of saw-palmetto are an important part of Florida black bear diets, and cabbage palmetto (Sabal palmetto) dominates the spring diet.</p>\\r\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Insects:</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tInsects obtained from coarse woody debris are important food items, primarily during summer. In northeastern Oregon, Bull and others reported higher frequencies of insect consumption than elsewhere in the United States. High consumption of insects may have been related to a shortage of other foods. Total frequency of insect occurrence in 621 American black bear scats collected between April and October over 2 years was 70%. During July of one year, total frequency of occurrence was 98%. Insects eaten included carpenter ants (Camponotus spp.), forest ants (Formica spp.), other ants (Lasius spp., Tapinoma spp., and Aphaenogaster spp.), and yellowjackets (Vespula spp. and Dolichovespula spp.). In the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem, army cutworm moths (Euxoa auxiliaris) are eaten during summer months. Feeding sites are located on scree slopes at high elevations (x=11,010 feet (3,356 m)), with alpine tundra-covered benches and plateaus above and below feeding sites.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Soft mast:</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe most common soft mast eaten by American black bears are berries produced by shrubs. Some of the more important masting species include blueberries (Vaccinium spp.), huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.), blackberries (Rubus spp.), serviceberries (Amelanchier spp.), strawberries (Fragaria spp.), autumn-olive (Elaeagnus umbellata), and russet buffaloberry (Shepherdia canadensis). Saw-palmetto fruits are an important year-round food item for Florida black bears. For a list of native fleshy fruits eaten by American black bears across their range, see Wilson.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Hard mast:</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tHard mast is important for American black bears in all geographic regions except the Pacific Northwest and is generally more abundant in eastern portions of the American black bear\'s range. American black bears may travel long distances during fall looking for hard mast and may climb up to 98 feet (30 m) in trees to forage. Hard mast eaten by American black bears may include acorns, hickory (Carya spp.) nuts, beechnuts (Fagus spp.), whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) seeds, limber pine (P. flexilis) seeds, and pinyon (Pinus spp.) seeds. Acorns preferred by American black bears include those of Gambel oak in ponderosa pine habitat in the Rocky Mountains, red oak and white oak in central hardwood forests, and Oregon white oak in the northwestern United States and southwestern Canada. Production of acorns is often episodic and synchronous, so acorns may not be a reliable food source. Whitebark pine seeds are a high-quality food for American black bears due to their high digestibility, relatively large size, and high fat content. Consumption of whitebark pine seeds occurs primarily south of the western US-Canada border. Use is greater in continental climates (18.7%) in the northern and central Rockies than in maritime climates (2.7%) in the northwestern United States. Within the Greater Yellowstone Area, American black bear consumption of whitebark pine seeds is greatest in mature stands (&gt;100 years old).</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>Whitebark pine seeds are eaten primarily during fall. American black bears may also raid red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) whitebark pine seed caches during spring. Whitebark pine cone production may vary widely based on site, individual trees, years, and white pine blister-rust infection. In Yellowstone National Park, large cone crops usually occur every 4 to 9 years. Seed consumption may vary considerably among years, depending on crop size. Heavy consumption of whitebark pine seeds occurs when crops average &gt;13 to 23 cones/tree. American black bears may eat seeds up to 1 year after crop production.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>In the Rocky Mountains, limber pine seeds may be an important food for American black bears when other foods are limited, and pinyon seeds are eaten in the Great Basin and southwestern United States.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Vertebrates:</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tAmerican black bears are more likely to eat carrion than to capture live prey; however, they are capable of killing vertebrates. Vertebrate carrion or prey items include woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), elk (Cervis canadensis), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), mule deer (O. hemionus), and moose (Alces alces). Other vertebrates eaten by American black bears include Mount Graham red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus grahamensis), sooty grouse (Dendragapus fuliginosus), bird eggs, and salmon (Oncorhynus spp.). Florida black bears may eat nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus) and feral pigs (Sus scrofa).</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Other:</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tStems and leaves of quaking aspen, poplar (Populus spp.) catkins, and black cottonwood buds are eaten during spring. When wild foods are scarce, American black bears may occasionally prey on domestic sheep, goats, pigs, and young cattle. They may also eat garbage, agricultural crops, and orchard fruits.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>For information on forage preferences and palatability ratings of American black bears in various phases within the grand fir/Rocky Mountain maple (Acer glabrum) habitat type and the Douglas-fir/white spirea (Spiraea betulifolia) habitat types in Idaho, see Steele and Geier-Hayes.

Male and female American black bears may kill and eat each other. American black bears of either sex can benefit from cannibalism; however, cannibalism is probably most common in large males.

Although it will avoid humans as much as it can, it will become fiercely aggressive when threatened or cornered. Even juveniles tend to be very aggressive. When cornered and provoked, it will spread its hood, hiss, sway from side to side and strike repeatedly; it is not a spitter. This terrestrial species is mainly diurnal, but it may be crepuscular and nocturnal in some parts of its range during the hottest months (July and August). It is a good climber and a good swimmer. It is often found in water and seldom found too far away from it. It feeds on small mammals, amphibians, and birds during the evening and early morning. The Caspian cobra will prey mainly on rodents, toads and frogs, occasionally fish, and birds and their eggs.

A number of small nonenzymatic proteins are found in the venom, including neurotoxins and members of the cytotoxin family, which have been shown to cause cell death through damage to lysosomes. In addition to nonenzymatic proteins, the venom also contains nucleases, which cause tissue damage at the site of the bite and may also potentiate systemic toxicity by releasing free purines in situ. A ribonuclease isolated and purified from Caspian cobra venom, ribonuclease V1, is commonly used as a laboratory reagent in molecular biology experiments due to its unusual ability to break down structured RNA.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><em>Toxic effects</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe crude venom of N. oxiana has a lowest published lethal dose (LCLo) of 0.005 mg/kg, the lowest among all cobra species, derived from an individual case of poisoning by intracerebroventricular injection. Values for subcutaneous injection average 0.18 mg/kg (range 0.1 mg/kg - 0.26 mg/kg). The murine subcutaneous LD50 value has been estimated between 0.21 mg/kg and 0.4 mg/kg. The intravenous injection route yielded estimates between 0.037 mg/kg and 0.078 mg/kg. Average venom yield per bite for this species is between 75 and 125 mg (dry weight), but can reach up to 590 mg.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>The bite of this species may cause severe pain and swelling, along with severe neurotoxicity. Weakness, drowsiness, ataxia, hypotension, and paralysis of throat and limbs may appear in less than one hour after the bite. Without medical treatment, symptoms rapidly worsen and death can occur soon after a bite due to respiratory failure. A woman bitten by this species in northwestern Pakistan suffered severe neurotoxicity and died while en route to the closest hospital nearly 50 minutes after envenomation. Between 1979 and 1987, 136 confirmed bites were attributed to this species in the former Soviet Union. Of the 136, 121 received antivenom, and only 8 died. Of the 15 who did not receive antivenom, 11 died - a 73% mortality rate. Antivenom is not as effective for envenomation by this species as it is for other Asiatic cobras within the same region, like the Indian cobra (Naja naja), and massive amounts of antivenom are often required for patients. As a result, a monovalent antivenom serum is being developed by the Razi Serum and Vaccine Research Institute in Iran. The untreated mortality rate for this species is approximately 70-75%, which is among the highest of all cobra species of the genus Naja. In both Central Asia and Iran this species is responsible for high rates of snakebites and resulting mortality.</p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n",

The beetle can be completely black in colour, black-brown, brown or reddish-yellow. Some species have dots. While the neck shield is mostly the same breadth, the wing covers vary, in some species they are fused together and the second pair of wings is shortened. The antennae comprise 11 parts. Some species have defence glands at the end of their abdomen with which they can exude malodorous secretions. The beetle larvae are long, round and yellowish in color.</p>\\n<p>Darkling beetles prefer hot and sandy habitats (deserts, steppes (large areas of flat unforested grassland). They are tyically encountered in dead wood, bark, straw, hay, leaves, tree fungi , abandoned nests, and even in buildings.</p>\\n<p>Both adult and darkling beetle larvae are herbivores or omnivores. They often live in in the company of other darkling beetles and feed on rotting plants, seeds, mushrooms or dead insects. Darkling beetles can cause major damage at food warehouses (Larvae of Meal worm beetles).</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p>Reference:<br />\\n\\t<a href=\\"http://insectoid.info/beetles/darkling-beetles/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Insectoid.info</a></p>\\n",

            \'value\' => "<p>The common raven was one of the many species originally described by Linnaeus in his 18th century work, Systema Naturae, and it still bears its original name of Corvus corax. It is the type species of the genus Corvus, derived from the Latin word for \\"raven\\". The specific epithet, corax/κοραξ, is the Ancient Greek word for \\"raven\\" or \\"crow\\".</p>\\r\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\r\\n\\t<p>The modern English word raven has cognates in all other Germanic languages, including Old Norse (and subsequently modern Icelandic) hrafn and Old High German (h)raban, all which descend from Proto-Germanic *khrabanas. An old Scottish word corby or corbie, akin to the French corbeau, has been used for both this bird and the carrion crow. Obsolete collective nouns for a group of ravens (or at least the common raven) include \\"unkindness\\" and \\"conspiracy\\". In practice, most people use the more generic \\"flock\\".</p>\\r\\n\\t<div class=\\"more\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t<p><u>Classification</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tThe closest relatives of the common raven are the brown-necked raven (C. ruficollis), the pied crow (C. albus) of Africa, and the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) of the North American southwest. While some authorities recognized as many as 11 subspecies, others only recognize eight.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p><u>Evolutionary history</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe common raven evolved in the Old World and crossed the Bering land bridge into North America. Recent genetic studies, which examined the DNA of common ravens from across the world, have determined that the birds fall into at least two clades: a California clade, found only in the southwestern United States, and a Holarctic clade, found across the rest of the Northern Hemisphere. Birds from both clades look alike, but the groups are genetically distinct and began to diverge about two million years ago.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The findings indicate that based on mitochondrial DNA, common ravens from the rest of the United States are more closely related to those in Europe and Asia than to those in the California clade, and that common ravens in the California clade are more closely related to the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) than to those in the Holarctic clade. Ravens in the Holarctic clade are more closely related to the pied crow (C. albus) than they are to the California clade. Thus, the common raven species as traditionally delimited is considered to be paraphyletic.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>One explanation for these genetic findings is that common ravens settled in California at least two million years ago and became separated from their relatives in Europe and Asia during an ice age. One million years ago, a group from the California clade evolved into a new species, the Chihuahuan raven. Other members of the Holarctic clade arrived later in a separate migration from Asia, perhaps at the same time as humans.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A recent study of raven mitochondrial DNA showed that the isolated population from the Canary Islands is distinct from other populations. The study did not include any individuals from the North African population, and its position is therefore unclear, though its morphology is very close to the population of the Canaries (to the extent that the two are often considered part of a single subspecies).</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p><u>Description</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA mature common raven ranges between 54 and 67 cm (21\\" and 26\\") long, with a wingspan of 115 to 130 cm (45–51\\"). Recorded weights range from 0.69 to 2 kg (1.5 to 4.4 lb), thus making the common raven one of the heaviest passerines. Birds from colder regions such as the Himalayas and Greenland are generally larger with slightly larger bills, while those from warmer regions are smaller with proportionally smaller bills. Representative of the size variation in the species, ravens from California weighed an average of 784 g (1.728 lb), those from Alaska weighed an average of 1,135 g (2.502 lb) and those from Nova Scotia weighed an average of 1,230 g (2.71 lb). The bill is large and slightly curved, with a culmen length of 5.7 to 8.5 cm (2.2 to 3.3 in), easily one of the largest bills amongst passerines (perhaps only the thick-billed raven has a noticeably larger bill). It has a longish, strongly graduated tail, at 20 to 26.3 cm (7.9 to 10.4 in), and mostly black iridescent plumage, and a dark brown iris. The throat feathers are elongated and pointed and the bases of the neck feathers are pale brownish-grey. The legs and feet are good-sized, with a tarsus length of 6 to 7.2 cm (2.4 to 2.8 in). Juvenile plumage is similar but duller with a blue-grey iris.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Apart from its greater size, the common raven differs from its cousins, the crows, by having a larger and heavier black beak, shaggy feathers around the throat and above the beak, and a wedge-shaped tail. Flying ravens are distinguished from crows by their tail shape, larger wing area, and more stable soaring style, which generally involves less wing flapping. Despite their bulk, ravens are easily as agile in flight as their smaller cousins. In flight the feathers produce a creaking sound that has been likened to the rustle of silk. The voice of ravens is also quite distinct, its usual call being a deep croak of a much more sonorous quality than a crow\'s call. In North America, the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) is fairly similar to the relatively small common ravens of the American southwest and is best distinguished by the still relatively smaller size of its bill, beard and body and relatively longer tail. All-black carrion crow (C. corone) in Europe may suggest a raven due to their largish bill but are still distinctly smaller and have the wing and tail shapes typical of crows.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the Faroe Islands a now extinct colour-morph of this species existed, known as the pied raven.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>White ravens are occasionally found in the wild. Birds in British Columbia lack the pink eyes of an albino, and are instead leucistic, a condition where an animal lacks any of several different types of pigment, not simply melanin.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Common ravens have a wide range of vocalizations which are of interest to ornithologists. Gwinner carried out important studies in the early 1960s, recording and photographing his findings in great detail. Fifteen to 30 categories of vocalization have been recorded for this species, most of which are used for social interaction. Calls recorded include alarm calls, chase calls, and flight calls. The species has a distinctive, deep, resonant prruk-prruk-prruk call, which to experienced listeners is unlike that of any other corvid. Its very wide and complex vocabulary includes a high, knocking toc-toc-toc, a dry, grating kraa, a low guttural rattle and some calls of an almost musical nature.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Like other corvids, ravens can mimic sounds from their environment, including human speech. Non-vocal sounds produced by the common raven include wing whistles and bill snapping. Clapping or clicking has been observed more often in females than in males. If a member of a pair is lost, its mate reproduces the calls of its lost partner to encourage its return.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><u>Distribution and habitat</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCommon ravens can thrive in varied climates; indeed this species has the largest range of any member of the genus, and one of the largest of any passerine. They range throughout the Holarctic from Arctic and temperate habitats in North America and Eurasia to the deserts of North Africa, and to islands in the Pacific Ocean. In the British Isles, they are more common in Scotland, Wales, northern England and the west of Ireland. In Tibet, they have been recorded at altitudes up to 5,000 m (16,400 ft), and as high as 6,350 m (20,600 ft) on Mount Everest. The population sometimes known as the Punjab raven—described as Corvus corax laurencei (also spelt lawrencii or laurencii) by Allan Octavian Hume but more often considered synonymous with subcorax—is restricted to the Sindh district of Pakistan and adjoining regions of northwestern India. They are generally resident within their range for the whole year. In his 1950 work, Grønlands Fugle [Birds of Greenland], noted ornithologist Finn Salomonsen indicated that common ravens did not overwinter in the Arctic. However, in Arctic Canada and Alaska, they are found year-round. Young birds may disperse locally.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Most common ravens prefer wooded areas with large expanses of open land nearby, or coastal regions for their nesting sites and feeding grounds. In some areas of dense human population, such as California in the United States, they take advantage of a plentiful food supply and have seen a surge in their numbers. On coasts, individuals of this species are often evenly distributed and prefer to build their nest sites along sea cliffs. Common ravens are often located in coastal regions because these areas provide easy access to water and a variety of food sources. Also, coastal regions have stable weather patterns without extreme cold or hot temperatures.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In general, common ravens live in a wide array of environments but prefer heavily contoured landscapes. When the environment changes in vast degrees, these birds will respond with a stress response. The hormone known as corticosterone is activated by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Corticosterone is activated when the bird is exposed to stress, such as migrating great distances.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><u>Behavior</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCommon ravens usually travel in mated pairs, although young birds may form flocks. Relationships between common ravens are often quarrelsome, yet they demonstrate considerable devotion to their families.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><u>Diet</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<u>Feeding</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCommon ravens are omnivorous and highly opportunistic: their diet may vary widely with location, season and serendipity. For example, those foraging on tundra on the Arctic North Slope of Alaska obtained about half their energy needs from predation, mainly of microtine rodents, and half by scavenging, mainly of caribou and ptarmigan carcasses.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In some places they are mainly scavengers, feeding on carrion as well as the associated maggots and carrion beetles. With large-bodied carrion, which they are not equipped to tear through as well as birds such as hook-billed vultures, they must wait for the prey to be torn open by another predator or flayed by other means. Plant food includes cereal grains, berries and fruit. They prey on small invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals and birds. Ravens may also consume the undigested portions of animal feces, and human food waste. They store surplus food items, especially those containing fat, and will learn to hide such food out of the sight of other common ravens. Ravens also raid the food caches of other species, such as the Arctic fox. They sometimes associate with another canine, the grey wolf, as a kleptoparasite, following to scavenge wolf-kills in winter. Ravens are regular predators at bird nests, brazenly picking off eggs, nestlings and sometimes adult birds when they spot an opportunity. They are considered perhaps the primary natural threat to the nesting success of the critically endangered California condor, since they readily take condor eggs and are very common in the areas where the species is being re-introduced.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Common ravens nesting near sources of human garbage included a higher percentage of food waste in their diet, birds nesting near roads consumed more road-killed vertebrates, and those nesting far from these sources of food ate more arthropods and plant material. Fledging success was higher for those using human garbage as a food source. In contrast, a 1984–1986 study of common raven diet in an agricultural region of south-western Idaho found that cereal grains were the principal constituent of pellets, though small mammals, grasshoppers, cattle carrion and birds were also eaten.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>One behavior is recruitment, where juvenile ravens call other ravens to a food bonanza, usually a carcass, with a series of loud yells. In Ravens in Winter, Bernd Heinrich posited that this behavior evolved to allow the juveniles to outnumber the resident adults, thus allowing them to feed on the carcass without being chased away. A more mundane explanation is that individuals co-operate in sharing information about carcasses of large mammals because they are too big for just a few birds to exploit. Experiments with baits however show that such recruitment behaviour is independent of the size of the bait.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Furthermore, there has been research suggesting that the common raven is involved in seed dispersal. In the wild, the common raven chooses the best habitat and disperses seeds in locations best suited for its survival.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><u>Predation</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOwing to its size, gregariousness and its defensive abilities, the common raven has few natural predators. Predators of its eggs include owls, martens, and sometimes eagles. Ravens are quite vigorous at defending their young and are usually successful at driving off perceived threats. They attack potential predators by flying at them and lunging with their large bills. Humans are occasionally attacked if they get close to a raven nest, though serious injuries are unlikely. There are a few records of predation by large birds of prey. Their attackers in America have reportedly included great horned owls, northern goshawks, bald eagles, golden eagles and red-tailed hawks, it is possible that the two hawks only have attacked young ravens, as had a peregrine falcon who in one instance swooped at a newly fledged raven but was successfully chased off by the parent ravens. In Eurasia, their reported predators include, in addition to golden eagles, Eurasian eagle-owls, white-tailed eagles, Steller\'s sea-eagles, eastern imperial eagles and gyrfalcons. Because they are potentially hazardous prey for raptorial birds, raptors must usually take them by surprise and most attacks are on fledgling ravens. More rarely still, large mammalian predators such as lynxes, coyotes and cougars have also attacked ravens. This principally occurs at a nest site and when other prey for the carnivores are scarce. Ravens are highly wary around novel carrion sites and, in North America, have been recorded waiting for the presence of American crows and blue jays before approaching to eat.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><u>Breeding</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJuveniles begin to court at a very early age, but may not bond for another two or three years. Aerial acrobatics, demonstrations of intelligence, and ability to provide food are key behaviors of courting. Once paired, they tend to nest together for life, usually in the same location. Instances of non-monogamy have been observed in common ravens, by males visiting a female\'s nest when her mate is away.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Breeding pairs must have a territory of their own before they begin nest-building and reproduction, and thus aggressively defend a territory and its food resources. Nesting territories vary in size according to the density of food resources in the area. The nest is a deep bowl made of large sticks and twigs, bound with an inner layer of roots, mud, and bark and lined with a softer material, such as deer fur. The nest is usually placed in a large tree or on a cliff ledge, or less frequently in old buildings or utility poles.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Females lay between three and seven pale bluish-green, brown-blotched eggs. Incubation is about 18 to 21 days, by the female only. However, the male may stand or crouch over the young, sheltering but not actually brooding them. Young fledge at 35 to 42 days, and are fed by both parents. They stay with their parents for another six months after fledging.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In most of their range, egg laying begins in late February. In colder climates, it is later, e.g. April in Greenland and Tibet. In Pakistan, egg-laying takes place in December. Eggs and hatchlings are preyed on, rarely, by large hawks and eagles, large owls, martens and canids. The adults, which are very rarely predated, are often successful in defending their young from these predators, due to their numbers, large size and cunning.

They display ability in problem-solving, as well as other cognitive processes such as imitation and insight.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Linguist Derek Bickerton, building on the work of biologist Bernd Heinrich, has argued that ravens are one of only four known animals (the others being bees, ants, and humans) who have demonstrated displacement, the capacity to communicate about objects or events that are distant in space or time from the communication. Young, unmated common ravens roost together at night, but usually forage alone during the day. However, when one discovers a large carcass guarded by a pair of adult ravens, the unmated raven will return to the roost and communicate the find. The following day, a flock of unmated ravens will fly to the carcass and chase off the adults. Bickerton argues that the advent of linguistic displacement was perhaps the most important event in the evolution of human language, and that ravens are the only other vertebrate to share this with humans.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>One experiment designed to evaluate insight and problem-solving ability involved a piece of meat attached to a string hanging from a perch. To reach the food, the bird needed to stand on the perch, pull the string up a little at a time, and step on the loops to gradually shorten the string. Four of five common ravens eventually succeeded, and \\"the transition from no success (ignoring the food or merely yanking at the string) to constant reliable access (pulling up the meat) occurred with no demonstrable trial-and-error learning.\\" This supports the hypothesis that common ravens are \'inventors\', implying that they can solve problems. Many of the feats of common ravens were formerly argued to be stereotyped innate behaviour, but it now has been established that their aptitudes for solving problems individually and learning from each other reflect a flexible capacity for intelligent insight unusual among non-human animals.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Common ravens have been observed calling wolves to the site of dead animals. The wolves open the carcass, leaving the scraps more accessible to the birds. They watch where other common ravens bury their food and remember the locations of each other\'s food caches, so they can steal from them. This type of theft occurs so regularly that common ravens will fly extra distances from a food source to find better hiding places for food. They have also been observed pretending to make a cache without actually depositing the food, presumably to confuse onlookers.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Common ravens are known to steal and cache shiny objects such as pebbles, pieces of metal, and golf balls. One theory is that they hoard shiny objects to impress other ravens. Other research indicates that juveniles are deeply curious about all new things, and that common ravens retain an attraction to bright, round objects based on their similarity to bird eggs. Mature birds lose their intense interest in the unusual, and become highly neophobic.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><u>Play</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThere has been increasing recognition of the extent to which birds engage in play. Juvenile common ravens are among the most playful of bird species. They have been observed to slide down snowbanks, apparently purely for fun. They even engage in games with other species, such as playing catch-me-if-you-can with wolves, otters and dogs. Common ravens are known for spectacular aerobatic displays, such as flying in loops or interlocking talons with each other in flight.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>They are also one of only a few wild animals who make their own toys.

In other areas, their numbers have increased dramatically and they have become agricultural pests. Common ravens can cause damage to crops, such as nuts and grain, or can harm livestock, particularly by killing young goat kids, lambs and calves. Ravens generally attack the faces of young livestock, but the more common raven behaviour of scavenging may be misidentified as predation by ranchers.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In the western Mojave Desert, human settlement and land development have led to an estimated 16-fold increase in the common raven population over 25 years. Towns, landfills, sewage treatment plants and artificial ponds create sources of food and water for scavenging birds. Ravens also find nesting sites in utility poles and ornamental trees, and are attracted to roadkill on highways. The explosion in the common raven population in the Mojave has raised concerns for the desert tortoise, a threatened species. Common ravens prey upon juvenile tortoises, which have soft shells and move slowly. Despite this, and there being no danger of extinction, the US Congress added ravens to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 in 1971. Plans to control the population have included shooting and trapping birds, as well as contacting landfill operators to ask that they reduce the amount of exposed garbage. A hunting bounty as a method of control was historically used in Finland from the mid-18th century until 1923. Culling has taken place to a limited extent in Alaska, where the population increase in common ravens is threatening the vulnerable Steller\'s eider (Polysticta stelleri).</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Cultural depictions<br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAcross its range in the Northern Hemisphere, and throughout human history, the common raven has been a powerful symbol and a popular subject of mythology and folklore.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In some Western traditions, ravens have long been considered to be birds of ill omen, death and evil in general, in part because of the negative symbolism of their all-black plumage and the eating of carrion. In Sweden, ravens are known as the ghosts of murdered people, and in Germany as the souls of the damned. In Danish folklore, valravne that ate a king\'s heart gained human knowledge, could perform great malicious acts, could lead people astray, had superhuman powers, and were \\"terrible animals\\".</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>As in traditional mythology and folklore, the common raven features frequently in more modern writings such as the works of William Shakespeare, and, perhaps most famously, in the poem \\"The Raven\\" by Edgar Allan Poe. Ravens have appeared in the works of Charles Dickens, J. R. R. Tolkien, Stephen King, George R. R. Martin and Joan Aiken among others.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>It continues to be used as a symbol in areas where it once had mythological status: as the national bird of Bhutan (Kings of Bhutan wear the Raven Crown), official bird of the Yukon territory, and on the coat of arms of the Isle of Man (once a Viking colony).</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In Persia and Arabia the raven was held as a bird of bad omen but a 14th-century Arabic work reports use of the raven in falconry.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>The modern unisex given name Raven is derived from the English word \\"raven\\". As a masculine name, Raven parallels the Old Norse Hrafn, and Old English *Hræfn, which were both bynames and personal names.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Mythology<br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tValkyrie speaks with a raven in a 19th-century illustration of the Old Norse poem Hrafnsmál (\\"raven song\\") by Frederick Sandys</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In Tlingit and Haida cultures, raven was both a trickster and creator god. Related beliefs are widespread among the peoples of Siberia and northeast Asia. The Kamchatka Peninsula, for example, was supposed to have been created by the raven god Kutkh. There are several references to common ravens in the Old Testament of the Bible and it is an aspect of Mahakala in Bhutanese mythology.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In Norse mythology, Huginn (from the Old Norse for \\"thought\\") and Muninn (Old Norse for \\"memory\\" or \\"mind\\") are a pair of ravens that fly all over the world, Midgard, and bring the god Odin information. Additionally among the Norse, raven banner standards were carried by such figures as the Jarls of Orkney, King Cnut the Great of England, Norway and Denmark, and Harald Hardrada. In the British Isles, ravens also were symbolic to the Celts. In Irish mythology, the goddess Morrígan alighted on the hero Cú Chulainn\'s shoulder in the form of a raven after his death. In Welsh mythology they were associated with the Welsh god Bran the Blessed, whose name translates to \\"raven.\\" According to the Mabinogion, Bran\'s head was buried in the White Hill of London as a talisman against invasion.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>A legend developed that England would not fall to a foreign invader as long as there were ravens at the Tower of London; although this is often thought to be an ancient belief, the official Tower of London historian, Geoff Parnell, believes that this is actually a romantic Victorian invention.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In the Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions, the raven was the first animal to be released from Noah\'s Ark. \\"So it came to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made. Then he sent out a raven, which kept going to and fro until the waters had dried up from the earth. He also sent out from himself a dove, to see if the waters had receded from the face of the ground.\\" The raven is mentioned a dozen times in the Bible. In the New Testament Jesus tells a parable using the raven to show how people should rely on God for their needs and not riches (Luke 12:24). The raven is also mentioned in Quran at the story of Cain and Abel. Adam\'s firstborn son Cain kills his brother Abel but he doesn\'t know what to do with the corpse: \\"Then Allah sent a raven scratching up the ground, to show him how to hide his brother\'s naked corpse. He said: Woe unto me! Am I not able to be as this raven and so hide my brother\'s naked corpse? And he became repentant.\\"</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<hr />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Reference<br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_raven\\">Wikipedia</a></p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t</div>\\r\\n\\t</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n",

It is the type species of the genus Corvus, derived from the Latin word for \\"raven\\". The specific epithet, corax/κοραξ, is the Ancient Greek word for \\"raven\\" or \\"crow\\".</p>\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\n<p>The modern English word raven has cognates in all other Germanic languages, including Old Norse (and subsequently modern Icelandic) hrafn and Old High German (h)raban, all which descend from Proto-Germanic *khrabanas. An old Scottish word corby or corbie, akin to the French corbeau, has been used for both this bird and the carrion crow. Obsolete collective nouns for a group of ravens (or at least the common raven) include \\"unkindness\\" and \\"conspiracy\\". In practice, most people use the more generic \\"flock\\".</p>\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\n<p><u>Classification</u><br />\\n\\t\\t\\tThe closest relatives of the common raven are the brown-necked raven (C. ruficollis), the pied crow (C. albus) of Africa, and the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) of the North American southwest. While some authorities recognized as many as 11 subspecies, others only recognize eight.</p>\\n<div>\\n<p><u>Evolutionary history</u><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe common raven evolved in the Old World and crossed the Bering land bridge into North America. Recent genetic studies, which examined the DNA of common ravens from across the world, have determined that the birds fall into at least two clades: a California clade, found only in the southwestern United States, and a Holarctic clade, found across the rest of the Northern Hemisphere. Birds from both clades look alike, but the groups are genetically distinct and began to diverge about two million years ago.</p>\\n<p>The findings indicate that based on mitochondrial DNA, common ravens from the rest of the United States are more closely related to those in Europe and Asia than to those in the California clade, and that common ravens in the California clade are more closely related to the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) than to those in the Holarctic clade. Ravens in the Holarctic clade are more closely related to the pied crow (C. albus) than they are to the California clade. Thus, the common raven species as traditionally delimited is considered to be paraphyletic.</p>\\n<p>One explanation for these genetic findings is that common ravens settled in California at least two million years ago and became separated from their relatives in Europe and Asia during an ice age. One million years ago, a group from the California clade evolved into a new species, the Chihuahuan raven. Other members of the Holarctic clade arrived later in a separate migration from Asia, perhaps at the same time as humans.</p>\\n<p>A recent study of raven mitochondrial DNA showed that the isolated population from the Canary Islands is distinct from other populations. The study did not include any individuals from the North African population, and its position is therefore unclear, though its morphology is very close to the population of the Canaries (to the extent that the two are often considered part of a single subspecies).</p>\\n<p><u>Description</u><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA mature common raven ranges between 54 and 67 cm (21\\" and 26\\") long, with a wingspan of 115 to 130 cm (45–51\\"). Recorded weights range from 0.69 to 2 kg (1.5 to 4.4 lb), thus making the common raven one of the heaviest passerines. Birds from colder regions such as the Himalayas and Greenland are generally larger with slightly larger bills, while those from warmer regions are smaller with proportionally smaller bills. Representative of the size variation in the species, ravens from California weighed an average of 784 g (1.728 lb), those from Alaska weighed an average of 1,135 g (2.502 lb) and those from Nova Scotia weighed an average of 1,230 g (2.71 lb). The bill is large and slightly curved, with a culmen length of 5.7 to 8.5 cm (2.2 to 3.3 in), easily one of the largest bills amongst passerines (perhaps only the thick-billed raven has a noticeably larger bill). It has a longish, strongly graduated tail, at 20 to 26.3 cm (7.9 to 10.4 in), and mostly black iridescent plumage, and a dark brown iris. The throat feathers are elongated and pointed and the bases of the neck feathers are pale brownish-grey. The legs and feet are good-sized, with a tarsus length of 6 to 7.2 cm (2.4 to 2.8 in). Juvenile plumage is similar but duller with a blue-grey iris.</p>\\n<p>Apart from its greater size, the common raven differs from its cousins, the crows, by having a larger and heavier black beak, shaggy feathers around the throat and above the beak, and a wedge-shaped tail. Flying ravens are distinguished from crows by their tail shape, larger wing area, and more stable soaring style, which generally involves less wing flapping. Despite their bulk, ravens are easily as agile in flight as their smaller cousins. In flight the feathers produce a creaking sound that has been likened to the rustle of silk. The voice of ravens is also quite distinct, its usual call being a deep croak of a much more sonorous quality than a crow\'s call. In North America, the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) is fairly similar to the relatively small common ravens of the American southwest and is best distinguished by the still relatively smaller size of its bill, beard and body and relatively longer tail. All-black carrion crow (C. corone) in Europe may suggest a raven due to their largish bill but are still distinctly smaller and have the wing and tail shapes typical of crows.</p>\\n<p>In the Faroe Islands a now extinct colour-morph of this species existed, known as the pied raven.</p>\\n<p>White ravens are occasionally found in the wild. Birds in British Columbia lack the pink eyes of an albino, and are instead leucistic, a condition where an animal lacks any of several different types of pigment, not simply melanin.</p>\\n<p>Common ravens have a wide range of vocalizations which are of interest to ornithologists. Gwinner carried out important studies in the early 1960s, recording and photographing his findings in great detail. Fifteen to 30 categories of vocalization have been recorded for this species, most of which are used for social interaction. Calls recorded include alarm calls, chase calls, and flight calls. The species has a distinctive, deep, resonant prruk-prruk-prruk call, which to experienced listeners is unlike that of any other corvid. Its very wide and complex vocabulary includes a high, knocking toc-toc-toc, a dry, grating kraa, a low guttural rattle and some calls of an almost musical nature.</p>\\n<p>Like other corvids, ravens can mimic sounds from their environment, including human speech. Non-vocal sounds produced by the common raven include wing whistles and bill snapping. Clapping or clicking has been observed more often in females than in males. If a member of a pair is lost, its mate reproduces the calls of its lost partner to encourage its return.</p>\\n<div>\\n<p><u>Distribution and habitat</u><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCommon ravens can thrive in varied climates; indeed this species has the largest range of any member of the genus, and one of the largest of any passerine. They range throughout the Holarctic from Arctic and temperate habitats in North America and Eurasia to the deserts of North Africa, and to islands in the Pacific Ocean. In the British Isles, they are more common in Scotland, Wales, northern England and the west of Ireland. In Tibet, they have been recorded at altitudes up to 5,000 m (16,400 ft), and as high as 6,350 m (20,600 ft) on Mount Everest. The population sometimes known as the Punjab raven—described as Corvus corax laurencei (also spelt lawrencii or laurencii) by Allan Octavian Hume but more often considered synonymous with subcorax—is restricted to the Sindh district of Pakistan and adjoining regions of northwestern India. They are generally resident within their range for the whole year. In his 1950 work, Grønlands Fugle [Birds of Greenland], noted ornithologist Finn Salomonsen indicated that common ravens did not overwinter in the Arctic. However, in Arctic Canada and Alaska, they are found year-round. Young birds may disperse locally.</p>\\n<p>Most common ravens prefer wooded areas with large expanses of open land nearby, or coastal regions for their nesting sites and feeding grounds. In some areas of dense human population, such as California in the United States, they take advantage of a plentiful food supply and have seen a surge in their numbers. On coasts, individuals of this species are often evenly distributed and prefer to build their nest sites along sea cliffs. Common ravens are often located in coastal regions because these areas provide easy access to water and a variety of food sources. Also, coastal regions have stable weather patterns without extreme cold or hot temperatures.</p>\\n<p>In general, common ravens live in a wide array of environments but prefer heavily contoured landscapes. When the environment changes in vast degrees, these birds will respond with a stress response. The hormone known as corticosterone is activated by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Corticosterone is activated when the bird is exposed to stress, such as migrating great distances.</p>\\n<p><u>Behavior</u><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCommon ravens usually travel in mated pairs, although young birds may form flocks. Relationships between common ravens are often quarrelsome, yet they demonstrate considerable devotion to their families.</p>\\n<p><u>Diet</u><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<u>Feeding</u><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCommon ravens are omnivorous and highly opportunistic: their diet may vary widely with location, season and serendipity. For example, those foraging on tundra on the Arctic North Slope of Alaska obtained about half their energy needs from predation, mainly of microtine rodents, and half by scavenging, mainly of caribou and ptarmigan carcasses.</p>\\n<p>In some places they are mainly scavengers, feeding on carrion as well as the associated maggots and carrion beetles. With large-bodied carrion, which they are not equipped to tear through as well as birds such as hook-billed vultures, they must wait for the prey to be torn open by another predator or flayed by other means. Plant food includes cereal grains, berries and fruit. They prey on small invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals and birds. Ravens may also consume the undigested portions of animal feces, and human food waste. They store surplus food items, especially those containing fat, and will learn to hide such food out of the sight of other common ravens. Ravens also raid the food caches of other species, such as the Arctic fox. They sometimes associate with another canine, the grey wolf, as a kleptoparasite, following to scavenge wolf-kills in winter. Ravens are regular predators at bird nests, brazenly picking off eggs, nestlings and sometimes adult birds when they spot an opportunity. They are considered perhaps the primary natural threat to the nesting success of the critically endangered California condor, since they readily take condor eggs and are very common in the areas where the species is being re-introduced.</p>\\n<p>Common ravens nesting near sources of human garbage included a higher percentage of food waste in their diet, birds nesting near roads consumed more road-killed vertebrates, and those nesting far from these sources of food ate more arthropods and plant material. Fledging success was higher for those using human garbage as a food source. In contrast, a 1984–1986 study of common raven diet in an agricultural region of south-western Idaho found that cereal grains were the principal constituent of pellets, though small mammals, grasshoppers, cattle carrion and birds were also eaten.</p>\\n<p>One behavior is recruitment, where juvenile ravens call other ravens to a food bonanza, usually a carcass, with a series of loud yells. In Ravens in Winter, Bernd Heinrich posited that this behavior evolved to allow the juveniles to outnumber the resident adults, thus allowing them to feed on the carcass without being chased away. A more mundane explanation is that individuals co-operate in sharing information about carcasses of large mammals because they are too big for just a few birds to exploit. Experiments with baits however show that such recruitment behaviour is independent of the size of the bait.</p>\\n<p>Furthermore, there has been research suggesting that the common raven is involved in seed dispersal. In the wild, the common raven chooses the best habitat and disperses seeds in locations best suited for its survival.</p>\\n<p><u>Predation</u><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOwing to its size, gregariousness and its defensive abilities, the common raven has few natural predators. Predators of its eggs include owls, martens, and sometimes eagles. Ravens are quite vigorous at defending their young and are usually successful at driving off perceived threats. They attack potential predators by flying at them and lunging with their large bills. Humans are occasionally attacked if they get close to a raven nest, though serious injuries are unlikely. There are a few records of predation by large birds of prey. Their attackers in America have reportedly included great horned owls, northern goshawks, bald eagles, golden eagles and red-tailed hawks, it is possible that the two hawks only have attacked young ravens, as had a peregrine falcon who in one instance swooped at a newly fledged raven but was successfully chased off by the parent ravens. In Eurasia, their reported predators include, in addition to golden eagles, Eurasian eagle-owls, white-tailed eagles, Steller\'s sea-eagles, eastern imperial eagles and gyrfalcons. Because they are potentially hazardous prey for raptorial birds, raptors must usually take them by surprise and most attacks are on fledgling ravens. More rarely still, large mammalian predators such as lynxes, coyotes and cougars have also attacked ravens. This principally occurs at a nest site and when other prey for the carnivores are scarce. Ravens are highly wary around novel carrion sites and, in North America, have been recorded waiting for the presence of American crows and blue jays before approaching to eat.</p>\\n<p><u>Breeding</u><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJuveniles begin to court at a very early age, but may not bond for another two or three years. Aerial acrobatics, demonstrations of intelligence, and ability to provide food are key behaviors of courting. Once paired, they tend to nest together for life, usually in the same location. Instances of non-monogamy have been observed in common ravens, by males visiting a female\'s nest when her mate is away.</p>\\n<p>Breeding pairs must have a territory of their own before they begin nest-building and reproduction, and thus aggressively defend a territory and its food resources. Nesting territories vary in size according to the density of food resources in the area. The nest is a deep bowl made of large sticks and twigs, bound with an inner layer of roots, mud, and bark and lined with a softer material, such as deer fur. The nest is usually placed in a large tree or on a cliff ledge, or less frequently in old buildings or utility poles.</p>\\n<p>Females lay between three and seven pale bluish-green, brown-blotched eggs. Incubation is about 18 to 21 days, by the female only. However, the male may stand or crouch over the young, sheltering but not actually brooding them. Young fledge at 35 to 42 days, and are fed by both parents. They stay with their parents for another six months after fledging.</p>\\n<p>In most of their range, egg laying begins in late February. In colder climates, it is later, e.g. April in Greenland and Tibet. In Pakistan, egg-laying takes place in December. Eggs and hatchlings are preyed on, rarely, by large hawks and eagles, large owls, martens and canids. The adults, which are very rarely predated, are often successful in defending their young from these predators, due to their numbers, large size and cunning. They have been observed dropping stones on potential predators that venture close to their nests.</p>\\n<p>Common ravens can be very long-lived, especially in captive or protected conditions; individuals at the Tower of London have lived for more than 40 years. Lifespans in the wild are considerably shorter at typically 10 to 15 years. The longest known lifespan of a banded wild common raven was 23 years, 3 months.</p>\\n<p><u>Intelligence</u></p>\\n<blockquote><p>Crows, ravens, magpies, and jays are not just feathered machines, rigidly programmed by their genetics.

A hunting bounty as a method of control was historically used in Finland from the mid-18th century until 1923. Culling has taken place to a limited extent in Alaska, where the population increase in common ravens is threatening the vulnerable Steller\'s eider (Polysticta stelleri).</p>\\n<p>Cultural depictions<br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAcross its range in the Northern Hemisphere, and throughout human history, the common raven has been a powerful symbol and a popular subject of mythology and folklore.</p>\\n<p>In some Western traditions, ravens have long been considered to be birds of ill omen, death and evil in general, in part because of the negative symbolism of their all-black plumage and the eating of carrion. In Sweden, ravens are known as the ghosts of murdered people, and in Germany as the souls of the damned. In Danish folklore, valravne that ate a king\'s heart gained human knowledge, could perform great malicious acts, could lead people astray, had superhuman powers, and were \\"terrible animals\\".</p>\\n<p>As in traditional mythology and folklore, the common raven features frequently in more modern writings such as the works of William Shakespeare, and, perhaps most famously, in the poem \\"The Raven\\" by Edgar Allan Poe. Ravens have appeared in the works of Charles Dickens, J. R. R. Tolkien, Stephen King, George R. R. Martin and Joan Aiken among others.</p>\\n<p>It continues to be used as a symbol in areas where it once had mythological status: as the national bird of Bhutan (Kings of Bhutan wear the Raven Crown), official bird of the Yukon territory, and on the coat of arms of the Isle of Man (once a Viking colony).</p>\\n<p>In Persia and Arabia the raven was held as a bird of bad omen but a 14th-century Arabic work reports use of the raven in falconry.</p>\\n<p>The modern unisex given name Raven is derived from the English word \\"raven\\". As a masculine name, Raven parallels the Old Norse Hrafn, and Old English *Hræfn, which were both bynames and personal names.</p>\\n<p>Mythology<br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tValkyrie speaks with a raven in a 19th-century illustration of the Old Norse poem Hrafnsmál (\\"raven song\\") by Frederick Sandys</p>\\n<p>In Tlingit and Haida cultures, raven was both a trickster and creator god. Related beliefs are widespread among the peoples of Siberia and northeast Asia. The Kamchatka Peninsula, for example, was supposed to have been created by the raven god Kutkh. There are several references to common ravens in the Old Testament of the Bible and it is an aspect of Mahakala in Bhutanese mythology.</p>\\n<p>In Norse mythology, Huginn (from the Old Norse for \\"thought\\") and Muninn (Old Norse for \\"memory\\" or \\"mind\\") are a pair of ravens that fly all over the world, Midgard, and bring the god Odin information. Additionally among the Norse, raven banner standards were carried by such figures as the Jarls of Orkney, King Cnut the Great of England, Norway and Denmark, and Harald Hardrada. In the British Isles, ravens also were symbolic to the Celts. In Irish mythology, the goddess Morrígan alighted on the hero Cú Chulainn\'s shoulder in the form of a raven after his death. In Welsh mythology they were associated with the Welsh god Bran the Blessed, whose name translates to \\"raven.\\" According to the Mabinogion, Bran\'s head was buried in the White Hill of London as a talisman against invasion.</p>\\n<p>A legend developed that England would not fall to a foreign invader as long as there were ravens at the Tower of London; although this is often thought to be an ancient belief, the official Tower of London historian, Geoff Parnell, believes that this is actually a romantic Victorian invention.</p>\\n<p>In the Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions, the raven was the first animal to be released from Noah\'s Ark. \\"So it came to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made. Then he sent out a raven, which kept going to and fro until the waters had dried up from the earth. He also sent out from himself a dove, to see if the waters had receded from the face of the ground.\\" The raven is mentioned a dozen times in the Bible. In the New Testament Jesus tells a parable using the raven to show how people should rely on God for their needs and not riches (Luke 12:24). The raven is also mentioned in Quran at the story of Cain and Abel. Adam\'s firstborn son Cain kills his brother Abel but he doesn\'t know what to do with the corpse: \\"Then Allah sent a raven scratching up the ground, to show him how to hide his brother\'s naked corpse. He said: Woe unto me! Am I not able to be as this raven and so hide my brother\'s naked corpse? And he became repentant.\\"</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p>Reference<br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_raven\\">Wikipedia</a></p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n",

Konrad Gessner wrote the first scientific description of a killer whale in his \\"Fish book\\" of 1558, based on examination of a dead stranded animal in the Bay of Greifswald that had attracted a great deal of local interest.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The killer whale is one of 35 species in the oceanic dolphin family, which first appeared about 11 million years ago. The killer whale lineage probably branched off shortly thereafter. Although it has morphological similarities with the pygmy killer whale, the false killer whale and the pilot whales, a study of cytochrome b gene sequences by Richard LeDuc indicated that its closest extant relatives are the snubfin dolphins of the genus Orcaella.</p>\\r\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Common names</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tEnglish-speaking scientists most often use the term \\"killer whale\\", although the term \\"orca\\" is increasingly used. Killer whale advocates point out it has a long heritage. Indeed, the genus name Orcinus means \\"of the kingdom of the dead\\", or \\"belonging to Orcus\\". Ancient Romans originally applied orca (plural orcae) to these animals, possibly borrowing it from the Greek ὄρυξ, which referred (among other things) to a whale species. Since the 1960s, \\"orca\\" has steadily grown in popularity; both names are now used. The term \\"orca\\" is euphemistically preferred by some to avoid the negative connotations of \\"killer\\", and because, being part of the family Delphinidae, the species is more closely related to other dolphins than to whales.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">According to some authors, the name killer whale is a mistranslation of the 18th century Spanish name asesina-ballenas which means literally whale killer. Basque whalers would have given it such name after observing pods of orcas hunting baleen whales.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">They are sometimes referred to as \\"blackfish\\", a name also used for other whale species. \\"Grampus\\" is a former name for the species, but is now seldom used. This meaning of \\"grampus\\" should not be confused with the genus Grampus, whose only member is Risso\'s dolphin.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Types</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe three to five types of killer whales may be distinct enough to be considered different races, subspecies, or possibly even species (see Species problem). The IUCN reported in 2008, \\"The taxonomy of this genus is clearly in need of review, and it is likely that O. orca will be split into a number of different species or at least subspecies over the next few years.\\" Although large variation in the ecological distinctiveness of different killer whale groups complicate simple differentiation into types, research off the west coast of Canada and the United States in the 1970s and 1980s identified the following three types:</p>\\r\\n\\t<ol>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tResident: These are the most commonly sighted of the three populations in the coastal waters of the northeast Pacific. Residents\' diets consist primarily of fish and sometimes squid, and they live in complex and cohesive family groups called pods. Female residents characteristically have rounded dorsal fin tips that terminate in a sharp corner. They visit the same areas consistently. British Columbia and Washington resident populations are amongst the most intensively studied marine mammals anywhere in the world. Researchers have identified and named over 300 killer whales over the past 30 years.</li>\\r\\n\\t</ol>\\r\\n\\t<div>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ol>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTransient: The diets of these whales consist almost exclusively of marine mammals. Transients generally travel in small groups, usually of two to six animals, and have less persistent family bonds than residents. Transients vocalize in less variable and less complex dialects. Female transients are characterized by more triangular and pointed dorsal fins than those of residents. The gray or white area around the dorsal fin, known as the \\"saddle patch\\", often contains some black colouring in residents. However, the saddle patches of transients are solid and uniformly gray. Transients roam widely along the coast; some individuals have been sighted in both southern Alaska and California. Transients are also referred to as Bigg\'s killer whale in honor of cetologist Michael Bigg. The term has become increasingly common and may eventually replace the transient label.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOffshore: A third population of killer whales in the northeast Pacific was discovered in 1988, when a humpback whale researcher observed them in open water. As their name suggests, they travel far from shore and feed primarily on schooling fish. However, because they have large, scarred and nicked dorsal fins resembling those of mammal-hunting transients, it may be that they also eat mammals and sharks. They have mostly been encountered off the west coast of Vancouver Island and near Haida Gwaii. Offshores typically congregate in groups of 20–75, with occasional sightings of larger groups of up to 200. Currently, little is known about their habits, but they are genetically distinct from residents and transients. Offshores appear to be smaller than the others, and females are characterized by dorsal fin tips that are continuously rounded.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ol>\\r\\n\\t\\t<div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Transients and residents live in the same areas, but avoid each other. The name \\"transient\\" originated from the belief that these killer whales were outcasts from larger resident pods. Researchers later discovered transients are not born into resident pods. The evolutionary split between the two groups is believed to have begun two million years ago. Genetic data indicate the types have not interbred for up to 10,000 years.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Other populations have not been as well studied, although specialized fish and mammal eating killer whales have been distinguished elsewhere. In addition, separate populations of \\"generalist\\" (fish- and mammal-eating) and \\"specialist\\" (mammal-eating) killer whales have been identified off northwestern Europe. As with residents and transients, the lifestyle of these whales appears to reflect their diet; fish-eating killer whales in Alaska and Norway have resident-like social structures, while mammal-eating killer whales in Argentina and the Crozet Islands behave more like transients.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Appearance and Morphology</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA typical killer whale distinctively bears a black back, white chest and sides, and a white patch above and behind the eye. Calves are born with a yellowish or orange tint, which fades to white. It has a heavy and robust body with a large dorsal fin up to 1.8 m (5.9 ft) tall. Behind the fin, it has a dark grey \\"saddle patch\\" across the back. Antarctic killer whales may have pale grey to nearly white backs. Adult killer whales are very distinctive and are not usually confused with any other sea creature.When seen from a distance, juveniles can be confused with other cetacean species, such as the false killer whale or Risso\'s dolphin. The killer whale\'s teeth are very strong and its jaws exert a powerful grip; the upper teeth fall into the gaps between the lower teeth when the mouth is closed. The front teeth are inclined slightly forward and outward, thus allowing the killer whale to withstand powerful jerking movements from its prey while the middle and back teeth hold it firmly in place.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Killer whales are the largest extant members of the dolphin family. Males typically range from 6 to 8 metres (20 to 26 ft) long and weigh in excess of 6 tonnes (5.9 long tons; 6.6 short tons). Females are smaller, generally ranging from 5 to 7 m (16 to 23 ft) and weighing about 3 to 4 tonnes (3.0 to 3.9 long tons; 3.3 to 4.4 short tons). The largest male killer whale on record was 9.8 m (32 ft), weighing 10 tonnes (9.8 long tons; 11 short tons), while the largest female was 8.5 m (28 ft), weighing 7.5 tonnes (7.4 long tons; 8.3 short tons). Calves at birth weigh about 180 kg (400 lb) and are about 2.4 m (7.9 ft) long. The killer whale\'s large size and strength make it among the fastest marine mammals, able to reach speeds in excess of 56 km/h (30 kn). The skeleton of the killer whale is of the typical delphinid structure, but is more robust. Its integument, unlike that of most other dolphin species, is characterised by a well-developed dermal layer with a dense network of fascicles of collagen fibers.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Killer whale pectoral fins, analogous to forelimbs, are large and rounded, resembling paddles. Males have significantly larger pectoral fins than females. At about 1.8 m (5.9 ft) the male\'s dorsal fin is more than twice the size of the female\'s and is more of a triangular shape—a tall, elongated isosceles triangle—whereas hers is shorter and more curved. Males and females also have different patterns of black and white skin in their genital areas. Sexual dimorphism is also apparent in the skull; adult males have longer lower jaws than females, and have larger occipital crests.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">An individual killer whale can often be identified from its dorsal fin and saddle patch. Variations such as nicks, scratches, and tears on the dorsal fin and the pattern of white or grey in the saddle patch are unique. Published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification has enabled the local population of killer whales to be counted each year rather than estimated, and has enabled great insight into lifecycles and social structures.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Occasionally a killer whale is white; they have been spotted in the northern Bering Sea and around St. Lawrence Island, and near the Russian coast. In February 2008, a white killer whale was photographed 3.2 km (2.0 mi) off Kanaga Volcano in the Aleutian Islands. In 2010, the Far East Russia Orca Project (FEROP), co-founded and co-directed by Alexander M. Burdin and Erich Hoyt, filmed an adult male nicknamed Iceberg .</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Killer whales have good eyesight above and below the water, excellent hearing, and a good sense of touch. They have exceptionally sophisticated echolocation abilities, detecting the location and characteristics of prey and other objects in their environments by emitting clicks and listening for echoes, as do other members of the dolphin family.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The mean body temperature of the orca is 36 to 38 °C (97 to 100 °F). Like most marine mammals, orcas have a layer of insulating blubber ranging from 7.6 to 10 cm (3.0 to 3.9 in) thick beneath its skin.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The heart beats at a rate of about 60 beats/min when the orca is at the surface, dropping to 30 beats/min when submerged.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Life cycle</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFemale killer whales begin to mature at around the age of 10 (reaching peak fertility around 20), which consists of periods of polyestrous cycling with noncycling periods of between three and 16 months. Females can often breed until age 40, after which comes a rapid decrease in fertility. As such, orcas are among the animals that undergo menopause and live for decades after they have finished breeding. The lifespans of wild females average 50 years. An exception is Granny (J2), who was the oldest known orca, estimated to have been 105 years old at the time of her death.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">To avoid inbreeding, males mate with females from other pods. Gestation varies from 15 to 18 months. &nbsp;Mothers calve, with usually a single offspring, about once every five years. In resident pods, births occur at any time of year, although winter is the most common. Mortality is extremely high during the first seven months of life, when 37–50% of all calves die. Weaning begins at about 12 months and completes by the age of two. According to observations in several regions, all male and female pod members participate in the care of the young.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Males sexually mature at the age of 15, but do not typically reproduce until age 21. Wild males live around 29 years on average, with a maximum of about 60 years.One male, known as Old Tom, was reportedly spotted every winter between the 1840s and 1930 off New South Wales, Australia. This would have made him up to 90 years old. Examination of his teeth indicated he died around age 35, but this method of age determination is now believed to be inaccurate for older animals. One male known to researchers in the Pacific Northwest (identified as J1) was estimated to have been 59 years old when he died in 2010.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Captive killer whale lifespans are typically significantly shorter, usually less than 25 years; however, numerous individuals are alive in their 30s, and a few have reached their 40s. Killer whales are unique among cetaceans, as their heads become relatively shorter as they age, i.e., the orca\'s caudal section enlongates more-so relative to its head.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Range and habitat</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKiller whales are found in all oceans and most seas. Due to their enormous range, numbers, and density, distributional estimates are difficult to compare, but they clearly prefer higher latitudes and coastal areas over pelagic environments.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Systematic surveys indicate the highest densities of killer whales (&gt;0.40 individuals per 100 km²) in the northeast Atlantic around the Norwegian coast, in the north Pacific along the Aleutian Islands, the Gulf of Alaska and in the Southern Ocean off much of the coast of Antarctica. They are considered \\"common\\" (0.20–0.40 individuals per 100 km²) in the eastern Pacific along the coasts of British Columbia, Washington and Oregon, in the North Atlantic Ocean around Iceland and the Faroe Islands. High densities have also been reported but not quantified in the western North Pacific around the Sea of Japan (in very limited areas and more abundant on the side of Primorsky Krai), Shiretoko Peninsula and off Kushiro (Resident and Transient groups began colonizing in these areas possibly after in 2000s), Sea of Okhotsk, Kuril Islands, Kamchatka and the Commander Islands and in the Southern Hemisphere off the coasts of South Australia, off the coast of northern to southern Brazil and the tip of southern Africa. They are reported as seasonally common in the Canadian Arctic, including Baffin Bay between Greenland and Nunavut, and around Tasmania and Macquarie Island. The northwest Atlantic population of at least 67 individuals ranges from Labrador and Newfoundland to New England with sightings to Cape Cod and Long Island.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Information for offshore regions and tropical waters is more scarce, but widespread, if not frequent, sightings indicate the killer whale can survive in most water temperatures. They have been sighted, for example, in the Mediterranean, the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the Indian Ocean around the Seychelles. In the Mediterranean, killer whales are considered \\"visitors\\" with the exception of one small population which lives in the Strait of Gibraltar. Except for northeastern basins from Black Sea, records have been among almost entire basin including Aegean and Levantine basins such as off Israel. A distinct population may also exist in Papua New Guinea. Distributions and abundances in other Asian waters are very unclear, only with sightings time to time have been reported, such as off Phuket and Mergui Archipelago.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Population structure in mid to lower latitudes of the North Pacific is unclear especially in coastal waters. Large concentrations are known to occur north of the Northern Mariana Islands and in the Gulf of Sendai, and repeated sightings are reported off Bali, the east coast of Taiwan, Ryukyu Islands, Izu Islands, in Tsushima Strait, and Izu Peninsula. The modern status of the species along coastal mainland China and its vicinity is unknown. Recorded sightings have been made from almost the entire shoreline; from Bohai and the Yellow Sea in the north to the Zhoushan Islands in the east and the Vietnam coast in the south.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In the Antarctic, killer whales range up to the edge of the pack ice and are believed to venture into the denser pack ice, finding open leads much like beluga whales in the Arctic. However, killer whales are merely seasonal visitors to Arctic waters, and do not approach the pack ice in the summer. With the rapid Arctic sea ice decline in the Hudson Strait, their range now extends deep into the northwest Atlantic. Occasionally, killer whales swim into freshwater rivers. They have been documented 100 mi (160 km) up the Columbia River in the United States. They have also been found in the Fraser River in Canada and the Horikawa River in Japan.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Migration patterns are poorly understood. Each summer, the same individuals appear off the coasts of British Columbia and Washington. Despite decades of research, where these animals go for the rest of the year remains unknown. Transient pods have been sighted from southern Alaska to central California.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Population</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWorldwide population estimates are uncertain, but recent consensus suggests an absolute minimum of 50,000. Local estimates include roughly 25,000 in the Antarctic, 8,500 in the tropical Pacific, 2,250–2,700 off the cooler northeast Pacific and 500–1,500 off Norway. Japan\'s Fisheries Agency estimated 2,321 killer whales were in the seas around Japan.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Feeding</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKiller whales are apex predators, meaning that they themselves have no natural predators. They are sometimes called the wolves of the sea, because they hunt in groups like wolf packs. Killer whales hunt varied prey including fish, cephalopods, mammals, sea birds and sea turtles. However, different populations or species tend to specialize and some can have a dramatic impact on certain prey species. Those that feed on mammals may not even recognize fish as food. This specialization in diet and hunting is another reason to suggest that the orca is in fact several species, as discussed above.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Fish</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFish-eating killer whales prey on around 30 species of fish. Some populations in the Norwegian and Greenland sea specialize in herring and follow that fish\'s autumnal migration to the Norwegian coast. Salmon account for 96% of northeast Pacific residents\' diet. About 65% of them are large, fatty Chinook. Chum salmon are also eaten, but smaller sockeye and pink salmon are not a significant food item. Depletion of specific prey species in an area is, therefore, cause for concern for local populations, despite the high diversity of prey. On average, a killer whale eats 227 kilograms (500 lb) each day. While salmon are usually hunted by an individual or a small group of individuals, herring are often caught using carousel feeding; the killer whales force the herring into a tight ball by releasing bursts of bubbles or flashing their white undersides. They then slap the ball with their tail flukes, either stunning or killing up to 15 fish at a time. The herring are then eaten one at a time. Carousel feeding has only been documented in the Norwegian killer whale population and with some oceanic dolphin species.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In New Zealand, sharks and rays appear to be important prey; species taken include eagle rays, long-tail and short-tail stingrays, common threshers, smooth hammerheads, blue sharks and shortfin mako sharks. With sharks, orcas may herd them to the surface and strike them with their tail flukes, while bottom-dwelling rays are cornered, pinned to the ground and taken to the surface. Killer whales can induce tonic immobility in sharks and rays by holding them upside down, rendering them helpless and incapable of injuring the whale. Some sharks suffocate within about 15 minutes while the whale holds them still, because these sharks need to move to breathe. In one incident filmed near the Farallon Islands in October 1997, a 4.7–5.3-metre (15–17 ft) female killed a 3–4-metre (9.8–13.1 ft) great white shark, apparently after swimming with it upside-down in her mouth and inducing tonic immobility in it. She and another pod member ate the shark\'s liver and allowed the rest of the carcass to sink. In February 2015, a pod of orcas was recorded to have killed a white shark off South Australia. Interspecific competition between the two species is probable in regions where dietary preferences overlap. In July 1992, two killer whales attacked, killed and fed on an 8-metre (26 ft) long whale shark, Rhincodon typus, in the waters off Bahia de los Angeles in Baja California.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Mammals</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKiller whales are very sophisticated and effective predators of marine mammals. Thirty-two cetacean species have been recorded as prey, from observing orcas\' feeding activity, examining the stomach contents of dead orcas, and seeing scars on the bodies of surviving prey animals. Groups even attack larger cetaceans such as minke whales, gray whales, and rarely sperm whales or blue whales.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Hunting large whales usually takes several hours. Killer whales generally choose to attack young or weak animals; however, a group of five or more may attack a healthy adult. When hunting a young whale, a group chases it and its mother until they wear out. Eventually, they separate the pair and surround the calf, preventing it from surfacing to breathe, drowning it. Pods of female sperm whales sometimes protect themselves by forming a protective circle around their calves with their flukes facing outwards, using them to repel the attackers. Rarely, large killer whale pods can overwhelm even adult female sperm whales. Adult bull sperm whales, which are large, powerful and aggressive when threatened, and fully grown adult blue whales, which are possibly too large to overwhelm, are not believed to be prey for killer whales.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Prior to the advent of industrial whaling, great whales may have been the major food source for killer whales. The introduction of modern whaling techniques may have aided killer whales by the sound of exploding harpoons indicating availability of prey to scavenge, and compressed air inflation of whale carcasses causing them to float, thus exposing them to scavenging. However, the toll on great whale populations by unfettered whaling had possibly reduced their availability as prey for killer whales, and caused them to expand their consumption of smaller marine mammals, thus contributing to their decline as well.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Predation by orcas on whale calves in high productivity, high latitude areas has been hypothesised to be the reason for great whale migrations to low productivity tropical waters, to reduce the risk of attacks on the highly vulnerable calves due to lower density of orcas in these waters.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Other marine mammal prey species include nearly 20 species of seal, sea lion and fur seal. Walruses and sea otters are less frequently taken. Often, to avoid injury, killer whales disable their prey before killing and eating it. This may involve throwing it in the air, slapping it with their tails, ramming it, or breaching and landing on it. Sea lions are killed by head-butting or after a stunning blow from a tail fluke. In the Aleutian Islands, a decline in sea otter populations in the 1990s was controversially attributed by some scientists to killer whale predation, although with no direct evidence. The decline of sea otters followed a decline in harbour seal and Steller sea lion populations, the killer whale\'s preferred prey, which in turn may be substitutes for their original prey, now decimated by industrial whaling.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In steeply banked beaches off Península Valdés, Argentina, and the Crozet Islands, killer whales feed on South American sea lions and southern elephant seals in shallow water, even beaching temporarily to grab prey before wriggling back to the sea. Beaching, usually fatal to cetaceans, is not an instinctive behaviour, and can require years of practice for the young. Killer whales can then release the animal near juvenile whales, allowing the younger whales to practice the difficult capture technique on the now-weakened prey. \\"Wave-hunting\\" killer whales spy-hop to locate Weddell seals, crabeater seals, leopard seals, and penguins resting on ice floes, and then swim in groups to create waves that wash over the floe. This washes the prey into the water, where other killer whales lie in wait.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Killer whales have also been observed preying on terrestrial mammals, such as deer swimming between islands off the northwest coast of North America. Killer whale cannibalism has also been reported based on analysis of stomach contents, but this is likely to be the result of scavenging remains dumped by whalers. One killer whale was also attacked by its companions after being shot. Although resident killer whales have never been observed to eat other marine mammals, they occasionally harass and kill porpoises and seals for no apparent reason.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Birds</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKiller whales in many areas may prey on cormorants and gulls. A captive killer whale at MarineLand discovered it could regurgitate fish onto the surface, attracting sea gulls, and then eat the birds. Four others then learned to copy the behaviour.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Behaviour</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDay-to-day killer whale behaviour generally consists of foraging, travelling, resting and socializing. Killer whales engage in frequent behaviour at the surface such as breaching (jumping completely out of the water) and tail-slapping. These activities may have a variety of purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodging parasites, or play. Spyhopping, a behaviour in which a whale holds its head above water, helps the animal view its surroundings.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Resident killer whales swim with porpoises, other dolphins, seals, and sea lions, which are common prey for transient killer whales.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Social structure</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKiller whales are notable for their complex societies. Only elephants and higher primates, such as humans, live in comparably complex social structures. Due to orcas\' complex social bonds and society, many marine experts have concerns about how humane it is to keep these animals in captive situations.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Resident killer whales in the eastern North Pacific have a particularly complex and stable social grouping system. Unlike any other mammal species whose social structure is known, residents live with their mothers for their entire lives. These family groups are based on matrilines consisting of the eldest female (matriarch) and her sons and daughters, and the descendants of her daughters, etc. The average size of a matriline is 5.5 animals. Because females can reach age 90, as many as four generations travel together. These matrilineal groups are highly stable. Individuals separate for only a few hours at a time, to mate or forage. With one exception, the killer whale named Luna, no permanent separation of an individual from a resident matriline has been recorded.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Closely related matrilines form loose aggregations called pods, usually consisting of one to four matrilines. Unlike matrilines, pods may separate for weeks or months at a time. DNA testing indicates resident males nearly always mate with females from other pods. Clans, the next level of resident social structure, are composed of pods with similar dialects, and common but older maternal heritage. Clan ranges overlap, mingling pods from different clans. The final association layer, perhaps more arbitrarily defined than the familial groupings, is called the community, and is defined as a set of clans that regularly commingle. Clans within a community do not share vocal patterns.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Transient pods are smaller than resident pods, typically consisting of an adult female and one or two of her offspring. Males typically maintain stronger relationships with their mothers than other females. These bonds can extend well into adulthood. Unlike residents, extended or permanent separation of transient offspring from natal matrilines is common, with juveniles and adults of both sexes participating. Some males become \\"rovers\\" and do not form long-term associations, occasionally joining groups that contain reproductive females. As in resident clans, transient community members share an acoustic repertoire, although regional differences in vocalizations have been noted.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Vocalizations</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLike all cetaceans, killer whales depend heavily on underwater sound for orientation, feeding, and communication. They produce three categories of sounds: clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls. Clicks are believed to be used primarily for navigation and discriminating prey and other objects in the surrounding environment, but are also commonly heard during social interactions.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Northeast Pacific resident groups tend to be much more vocal than transient groups in the same waters. Residents feed primarily on Chinook and chum salmon, species that are insensitive to killer whale calls (inferred from the audiogram of Atlantic salmon). In contrast, the marine mammal prey of transients hear well underwater at the frequencies used in killer whale calls. As such, transients are typically silent, probably to avoid alerting their mammalian prey. They sometimes use a single click (called a cryptic click) rather than the long train of clicks observed in other populations. Residents are only silent when resting.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">All members of a resident pod use similar calls, known collectively as a dialect. Dialects are composed of specific numbers and types of discrete, repetitive calls. They are complex and stable over time. Call patterns and structure are distinctive within matrilines. Newborns produce calls similar to their mothers, but have a more limited repertoire. Individuals likely learn their dialect through contact with their mother and other pod members. For instance, family-specific calls have been observed more frequently in the days following a calf\'s birth, which may help the calf learn them. Dialects are probably an important means of maintaining group identity and cohesiveness. Similarity in dialects likely reflects the degree of relatedness between pods, with variation building over time. When pods meet, dominant call types decrease and subset call types increase. The use of both call types is called biphonation. The increased subset call types may be the distinguishing factor between pods and inter-pod relations.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Dialects of killer whales not only distinguish them between pods, but also between types. Resident dialects contain seven to 17 (mean = 11) distinctive call types. All members of the North American west coast transient community express the same basic dialect, although minor regional variation in call types is evident. Preliminary research indicates offshore killer whales have group-specific dialects unlike those of residents and transients.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The vocalizations of killer whales in other parts of the world have also been studied. Norwegian and Icelandic herring-eating orcas appear to have different vocalizations for activities like hunting and traveling.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Intelligence</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKiller whales have the second-heaviest brains among marine mammals (after sperm whales, which have the largest brain of any animal). They can be trained in captivity and are often described as intelligent, although defining and measuring \\"intelligence\\" is difficult in a species whose environment and behavioural strategies are very different from those of humans.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Killer whales imitate others, and seem to deliberately teach skills to their kin. Off the Crozet Islands, mothers push their calves onto the beach, waiting to pull the youngster back if needed.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">People who have interacted closely with killer whales offer numerous anecdotes demonstrating the whales\' curiosity, playfulness, and ability to solve problems. Alaskan killer whales have not only learned how to steal fish from longlines, but have also overcome a variety of techniques designed to stop them, such as the use of unbaited lines as decoys. Once, fishermen placed their boats several miles apart, taking turns retrieving small amounts of their catch, in the hope that the whales would not have enough time to move between boats to steal the catch as it was being retrieved. A researcher described what happened next:</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<blockquote>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">It worked really well for a while. Then the whales split into two groups. It didn\'t even take them an hour to figure it out. They were so thrilled when they figured out what was going on, that we were playing games. They were breaching by the boats.<br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t— Craig Matkin</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</blockquote>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In other anecdotes, researchers describe incidents in which wild killer whales playfully tease humans by repeatedly moving objects the humans are trying to reach, or suddenly start to toss around a chunk of ice after a human throws a snowball.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The killer whale\'s use of dialects and the passing of other learned behaviours from generation to generation have been described as a form of animal culture.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The complex and stable vocal and behavioural cultures of sympatric groups of killer whales (Orcinus orca) appear to have no parallel outside humans and represent an independent evolution of cultural faculties.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Conservation<br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn 2008, the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) changed its assessment of the killer whale\'s conservation status from conservation dependent to data deficient, recognizing that one or more killer whale types may actually be separate, endangered species. Depletion of prey species, pollution, large-scale oil spills, and habitat disturbance caused by noise and conflicts with boats are currently the most significant worldwide threats.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Like other animals at the highest trophic levels, the killer whale is particularly at risk of poisoning from bioaccumulation of toxins, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). European harbour seals have problems in reproductive and immune functions associated with high levels of PCBs and related contaminants, and a survey off the Washington coast found PCB levels in killer whales were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbour seals. Blubber samples in the Norwegian Arctic show higher levels of PCBs, pesticides and brominated flame-retardants than in polar bears. When food is scarce, killer whales metabolize blubber for energy, which increases pollutant concentrations in their blood.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In the Pacific Northwest, wild salmon stocks, a main resident food source, have declined dramatically in recent years. On the west coast of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, seal and sea lion populations have also substantially declined.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In 2005, the United States government listed the southern resident community as an endangered population under the Endangered Species Act. This community comprises three pods which live mostly in the Georgia and Haro Straits and Puget Sound in British Columbia and Washington. They do not breed outside of their community, which was once estimated at around 200 animals and later shrank to around 90. In October 2008, the annual survey revealed seven were missing and presumed dead, reducing the count to 83. This is potentially the largest decline in the population in the past ten years. These deaths can be attributed to declines in Chinook salmon.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Scientist Ken Balcomb has extensively studied killer whales since 1976; he is the research biologist responsible for discovering U.S. Navy sonar may harm killer whales. He studied killer whales from the Center for Whale Research, located in Friday Harbor, Washington. He was also able to study killer whales from \\"his home porch perched above Puget Sound, where the animals hunt and play in summer months\\". In May 2003, Balcomb (along with other whale watchers near the Puget Sound coastline) noticed uncharacteristic behaviour displayed by the killer whales. The whales seemed \\"agitated and were moving haphazardly, attempting to lift their heads free of the water\\" to escape the sound of the sonars. \\"Balcomb confirmed at the time that strange underwater pinging noises detected with underwater microphones were sonar. The sound originated from a U.S. Navy frigate 12 miles (19 kilometers) distant, Balcomb said.\\" The impact of sonar waves on killer whales is potentially life-threatening. Three years prior to Balcomb\'s discovery, research in the Bahamas showed 14 beaked whales washed up on the shore. These whales were beached on the day U.S. Navy destroyers were activated into sonar exercise. Of the 14 whales beached, six of them died. These six dead whales were studied, and CAT scans of two of the whale heads showed hemorrhaging around the brain and the ears, which is consistent with decompression sickness.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Another conservation concern was made public in September 2008 when the Canadian government decided it was not necessary to enforce further protections (including the Species at Risk Act in place to protect endangered animals along their habitats) for killer whales aside from the laws already in place. In response to this decision, six environmental groups sued the federal government, claiming killer whales were facing many threats on the British Columbia Coast and the federal government did nothing to protect them from these threats. A legal and scientific nonprofit organization, Ecojustice, led the lawsuit and represented the David Suzuki Foundation, Environmental Defence, Greenpeace Canada, International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Raincoast Conservation Foundation, and the Wilderness Committee. Many scientists involved in this lawsuit, including Bill Wareham, a marine scientist with the David Suzuki Foundation, noted increased boat traffic, water toxic wastes, and low salmon population as major threats, putting approximately 87 killer whales on the British Columbia Coast in danger.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Underwater noise from shipping, drilling, and other human activities is a significant concern in some key killer whale habitats, including Johnstone Strait and Haro Strait. In the mid-1990s, loud underwater noises from salmon farms were used to deter seals. Killer whales also avoided the surrounding waters. High-intensity sonar used by the Navy disturbs killer whales along with other marine mammals. Killer whales are popular with whale watchers, which may stress the whales and alter their behaviour, particularly if boats approach too closely or block their lines of travel.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The Exxon Valdez oil spill adversely affected killer whales in Prince William Sound and Alaska\'s Kenai Fjords region. Eleven members (about half) of one resident pod disappeared in the following year. The spill damaged salmon and other prey populations, which in turn damaged local killer whales. By 2009, scientists estimated the AT1 transient population (considered part of a larger population of 346 transients), numbered only seven individuals and had not reproduced since the spill. This population is expected to die out.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Relationship with humans</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<em>Indigenous cultures</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast feature killer whales throughout their art, history, spirituality and religion. The Haida regarded killer whales as the most powerful animals in the ocean, and their mythology tells of killer whales living in houses and towns under the sea. According to these myths, they took on human form when submerged, and humans who drowned went to live with them. For the Kwakwaka\'wakw, the killer whale was regarded as the ruler of the undersea world, with sea lions for slaves and dolphins for warriors. In Nuu-chah-nulth and Kwakwaka\'wakw mythology, killer whales may embody the souls of deceased chiefs. The Tlingit of southeastern Alaska regarded the killer whale as custodian of the sea and a benefactor of humans.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The Maritime Archaic people of Newfoundland also had great respect for killer whales, as evidenced by stone carvings found in a 4,000-year-old burial at the Port au Choix Archaeological Site.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In the tales and beliefs of the Siberian Yupik people, killer whales are said to appear as wolves in winter, and wolves as killer whales in summer. Killer whales are believed to assist their hunters in driving walrus. Reverence is expressed in several forms: the boat represents the animal, and a wooden carving hung from the hunter\'s belt. Small sacrifices such as tobacco are strewn into the sea for them. Killer whales were believed to have helped the hunters even when in wolf guise, by forcing reindeer to allow themselves to be killed.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>\\"Killer\\" stereotype</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn Western cultures, killer whales were historically feared as dangerous, savage predators. The first written description of a killer whale was given by Pliny the Elder circa AD 70, who wrote, \\"Orcas (the appearance of which no image can express, other than an enormous mass of savage flesh with teeth) are the enemy of [other whales]... they charge and pierce them like warships ramming.\\"</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Of the very few confirmed attacks on humans by wild killer whales, none have been fatal. In one instance, killer whales tried to tip ice floes on which a dog team and photographer of the Terra Nova Expedition was standing. The sled dogs\' barking is speculated to have sounded enough like seal calls to trigger the killer whale\'s hunting curiosity. In the 1970s, a surfer in California was bitten, and in 2005, a boy in Alaska who was splashing in a region frequented by harbor seals was bumped by a killer whale that apparently misidentified him as prey. Unlike wild killer whales, captive killer whales are reported to have made nearly two dozen attacks on humans since the 1970s, some of which have been fatal.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Competition with fishermen also led to killer whales being regarded as pests. In the waters of the Pacific Northwest and Iceland, the shooting of killer whales was accepted and even encouraged by governments. As an indication of the intensity of shooting that occurred until fairly recently, about 25% of the killer whales captured in Puget Sound for aquaria through 1970 bore bullet scars. The U.S. Navy claimed to have deliberately killed hundreds of killer whales in Icelandic waters in 1956 with machine-guns, rockets, and depth charges.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Modern Western attitudes</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWestern attitudes towards killer whales have changed dramatically in recent decades. In the mid-1960s and early 1970s, killer whales came to much greater public and scientific awareness, starting with the first live-capture and display of a killer whale known as Moby Doll, a resident harpooned off Saturna Island in 1964. So little was known at the time, it was nearly two months before the whale\'s keepers discovered what food (fish) it was willing to eat. To the surprise of those who saw him, Moby Doll was a docile, nonaggressive whale that made no attempts to attack humans.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Between 1964 and 1976, 50 killer whales from the Pacific Northwest were captured for display in aquaria, and public interest in the animals grew. In the 1970s, research pioneered by Michael Bigg led to the discovery of the species\' complex social structure, its use of vocal communication, and its extraordinarily stable mother–offspring bonds. Through photo-identification techniques, individuals were named and tracked over decades.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Bigg\'s techniques also revealed the Pacific Northwest population was in the low hundreds rather than the thousands that had been previously assumed. The southern resident community alone had lost 48 of its members to captivity; by 1976, only 80 remained. In the Pacific Northwest, the species that had unthinkingly been targeted became a cultural icon within a few decades.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The public\'s growing appreciation also led to growing opposition to whale–keeping in aquaria. Only one whale has been taken in North American waters since 1976. In recent years, the extent of the public\'s interest in killer whales has manifested itself in several high-profile efforts surrounding individuals. Following the success of the 1993 film Free Willy, the movie\'s captive star Keiko was returned to the coast of his native Iceland in 1998. The director of the International Marine Mammal Project for the Earth Island Institute, David Phillips, led the efforts to return Keiko to the Iceland waters. In 2002 the orphan Springer was discovered in Puget Sound, Washington. She became the first whale to be successfully reintegrated into a wild pod after human intervention, crystallizing decades of research into the vocal behaviour and social structure of the region\'s killer whales. The saving of Springer raised hopes that another young killer whale named Luna, which had become separated from his pod, could be returned to it. However, his case was marked by controversy about whether and how to intervene, and in 2006, Luna was killed by a boat propeller.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Whaling</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tA killer whale swims alongside a whaling boat, with a smaller whale in between. Two men are standing, the harpooner in the bow and a steersman on the aft rudder, while four oarsmen are seated.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The killer whale named Old Tom swims alongside a whaleboat, flanking a whale calf. The boat is being towed by a harpooned whale, near Eden, Australia.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The earlier of known records of commercial hunting of killer whales date to the 18th century in Japan. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the global whaling industry caught immense numbers of baleen and sperm whales, but largely ignored killer whales because of their limited amounts of recoverable oil, their smaller populations, and the difficulty of taking them. Once the stocks of larger species were depleted, killer whales were targeted by commercial whalers in the mid-20th century. Between 1954 and 1997, Japan took 1,178 killer whales (although the Ministry of the Environment claims that there had been domestic catches of about 1,600 whales between late 1940s to 1960s) and Norway took 987. Over 3,000 killer whales were taken by Soviet whalers, including an Antarctic catch of 916 in 1979–80 alone, prompting the International Whaling Commission to recommend a ban on commercial hunting of the species pending further research. (Compare with the situation on land, Commercial hunting.) Today, no country carries out a substantial hunt, although Indonesia and Greenland permit small subsistence hunts (see Aboriginal whaling). Other than commercial hunts, killer whales were hunted along Japanese coasts out of public concern for potential conflicts with fisheries. Such cases include a semi-resident male-female pair in Akashi Strait and Harimanada being killed in the Seto Inland Sea in 1957, the killing of five whales from a pod of 11 members that swam into Tokyo Bay in 1970, and a catch record in southern Taiwan in the 1990s.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Cooperation with humans</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tKiller whales have helped humans hunting other whales. One well-known example was the killer whales of Eden, Australia, including the male known as Old Tom. Whalers more often considered them a nuisance, however, as orcas would gather to scavenge meat from the whalers\' catch. Some populations, such as in Alaska\'s Prince William Sound, may have been reduced significantly by whalers shooting them in retaliation.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Captivity</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe killer whale\'s intelligence, trainability, striking appearance, playfulness in captivity and sheer size have made it a popular exhibit at aquaria and aquatic theme parks. From 1976 to 1997, 55 whales were taken from the wild in Iceland, 19 from Japan, and three from Argentina. These figures exclude animals that died during capture. Live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Organizations such as World Animal Protection and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society campaign against the practice of keeping them in captivity. In captivity, they often develop pathologies, such as the dorsal fin collapse seen in 60–90% of captive males. Captives have vastly reduced life expectancies, on average only living into their 20s. In the wild, females who survive infancy live 46 years on average, and up to 70–80 years in rare cases. Wild males who survive infancy live 31 years on average, and up to 50–60 years. Captivity usually bears little resemblance to wild habitat, and captive whales\' social groups are foreign to those found in the wild. Critics claim captive life is stressful due to these factors and the requirement to perform circus tricks that are not part of wild killer whale behaviour, see above. Wild killer whales may travel up to 160 kilometres (100 mi) in a day, and critics say the animals are too big and intelligent to be suitable for captivity. Captives occasionally act aggressively towards themselves, their tankmates, or humans, which critics say is a result of stress. Between 1991 and 2010, the bull orca known as Tilikum was involved in the death of three people, and was featured in the critically acclaimed 2013 film, Blackfish Tilikum has lived at SeaWorld since 1992.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">A 2015 study coauthored by staff at SeaWorld and the Minnesota Zoo indicates that there is no significant difference in survivorship between free-ranging and captive killer whales. The authors speculate about the future utility of studying captive populations for the purposes of understanding orca biology and the implications of such research of captive animals in the overall health of both wild and marine park populations. The study has been criticised by Dr Trevor Willis, senior lecture in marine biology at the University of Portsmouth, who stated that the study is misleading, \\"clearly wrong\\" and indicative of \\"poor practice\\". He said that this is the case because it compares swimming pools to the wild ocean and the extrapolates the survival rates of calves to life expectancy in adulthood.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">As of March 2016, SeaWorld has announced that they will be ending their orca breeding program and their theatrical shows. They previously announced, in November 2015, that the shows would be coming to an end in San Diego but it is now to happen in both Orlando and San Antonio as well.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t</div>\\r\\n\\t</div>\\r\\n\\t<hr />\\r\\n\\t<p>References:</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_whale\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Wikipedia</a></p>\\r\\n\\t<p><a href=\\"http://www.nature.com/news/scientists-clash-over-lifespan-of-captive-killer-whales-1.19623?WT.ec_id=NEWSDAILY-20170109\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Nature</a></p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n",

Konrad Gessner wrote the first scientific description of a killer whale in his \\"Fish book\\" of 1558, based on examination of a dead stranded animal in the Bay of Greifswald that had attracted a great deal of local interest.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The killer whale is one of 35 species in the oceanic dolphin family, which first appeared about 11 million years ago. The killer whale lineage probably branched off shortly thereafter. Although it has morphological similarities with the pygmy killer whale, the false killer whale and the pilot whales, a study of cytochrome b gene sequences by Richard LeDuc indicated that its closest extant relatives are the snubfin dolphins of the genus Orcaella.</p>\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Common names</strong><br />\\n\\t\\tEnglish-speaking scientists most often use the term \\"killer whale\\", although the term \\"orca\\" is increasingly used. Killer whale advocates point out it has a long heritage. Indeed, the genus name Orcinus means \\"of the kingdom of the dead\\", or \\"belonging to Orcus\\". Ancient Romans originally applied orca (plural orcae) to these animals, possibly borrowing it from the Greek ὄρυξ, which referred (among other things) to a whale species. Since the 1960s, \\"orca\\" has steadily grown in popularity; both names are now used. The term \\"orca\\" is euphemistically preferred by some to avoid the negative connotations of \\"killer\\", and because, being part of the family Delphinidae, the species is more closely related to other dolphins than to whales.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">According to some authors, the name killer whale is a mistranslation of the 18th century Spanish name asesina-ballenas which means literally whale killer. Basque whalers would have given it such name after observing pods of orcas hunting baleen whales.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">They are sometimes referred to as \\"blackfish\\", a name also used for other whale species. \\"Grampus\\" is a former name for the species, but is now seldom used. This meaning of \\"grampus\\" should not be confused with the genus Grampus, whose only member is Risso\'s dolphin.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Types</strong><br />\\n\\t\\tThe three to five types of killer whales may be distinct enough to be considered different races, subspecies, or possibly even species (see Species problem). The IUCN reported in 2008, \\"The taxonomy of this genus is clearly in need of review, and it is likely that O. orca will be split into a number of different species or at least subspecies over the next few years.\\" Although large variation in the ecological distinctiveness of different killer whale groups complicate simple differentiation into types, research off the west coast of Canada and the United States in the 1970s and 1980s identified the following three types:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tResident: These are the most commonly sighted of the three populations in the coastal waters of the northeast Pacific. Residents\' diets consist primarily of fish and sometimes squid, and they live in complex and cohesive family groups called pods. Female residents characteristically have rounded dorsal fin tips that terminate in a sharp corner. They visit the same areas consistently. British Columbia and Washington resident populations are amongst the most intensively studied marine mammals anywhere in the world. Researchers have identified and named over 300 killer whales over the past 30 years.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<div>\\n<ol>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTransient: The diets of these whales consist almost exclusively of marine mammals. Transients generally travel in small groups, usually of two to six animals, and have less persistent family bonds than residents. Transients vocalize in less variable and less complex dialects. Female transients are characterized by more triangular and pointed dorsal fins than those of residents. The gray or white area around the dorsal fin, known as the \\"saddle patch\\", often contains some black colouring in residents. However, the saddle patches of transients are solid and uniformly gray. Transients roam widely along the coast; some individuals have been sighted in both southern Alaska and California. Transients are also referred to as Bigg\'s killer whale in honor of cetologist Michael Bigg. The term has become increasingly common and may eventually replace the transient label.</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOffshore: A third population of killer whales in the northeast Pacific was discovered in 1988, when a humpback whale researcher observed them in open water. As their name suggests, they travel far from shore and feed primarily on schooling fish. However, because they have large, scarred and nicked dorsal fins resembling those of mammal-hunting transients, it may be that they also eat mammals and sharks. They have mostly been encountered off the west coast of Vancouver Island and near Haida Gwaii. Offshores typically congregate in groups of 20–75, with occasional sightings of larger groups of up to 200. Currently, little is known about their habits, but they are genetically distinct from residents and transients. Offshores appear to be smaller than the others, and females are characterized by dorsal fin tips that are continuously rounded.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<div>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Transients and residents live in the same areas, but avoid each other. The name \\"transient\\" originated from the belief that these killer whales were outcasts from larger resident pods. Researchers later discovered transients are not born into resident pods. The evolutionary split between the two groups is believed to have begun two million years ago. Genetic data indicate the types have not interbred for up to 10,000 years.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Other populations have not been as well studied, although specialized fish and mammal eating killer whales have been distinguished elsewhere. In addition, separate populations of \\"generalist\\" (fish- and mammal-eating) and \\"specialist\\" (mammal-eating) killer whales have been identified off northwestern Europe. As with residents and transients, the lifestyle of these whales appears to reflect their diet; fish-eating killer whales in Alaska and Norway have resident-like social structures, while mammal-eating killer whales in Argentina and the Crozet Islands behave more like transients.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Appearance and Morphology</strong><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA typical killer whale distinctively bears a black back, white chest and sides, and a white patch above and behind the eye. Calves are born with a yellowish or orange tint, which fades to white. It has a heavy and robust body with a large dorsal fin up to 1.8 m (5.9 ft) tall. Behind the fin, it has a dark grey \\"saddle patch\\" across the back. Antarctic killer whales may have pale grey to nearly white backs. Adult killer whales are very distinctive and are not usually confused with any other sea creature.When seen from a distance, juveniles can be confused with other cetacean species, such as the false killer whale or Risso\'s dolphin. The killer whale\'s teeth are very strong and its jaws exert a powerful grip; the upper teeth fall into the gaps between the lower teeth when the mouth is closed. The front teeth are inclined slightly forward and outward, thus allowing the killer whale to withstand powerful jerking movements from its prey while the middle and back teeth hold it firmly in place.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Killer whales are the largest extant members of the dolphin family. Males typically range from 6 to 8 metres (20 to 26 ft) long and weigh in excess of 6 tonnes (5.9 long tons; 6.6 short tons). Females are smaller, generally ranging from 5 to 7 m (16 to 23 ft) and weighing about 3 to 4 tonnes (3.0 to 3.9 long tons; 3.3 to 4.4 short tons). The largest male killer whale on record was 9.8 m (32 ft), weighing 10 tonnes (9.8 long tons; 11 short tons), while the largest female was 8.5 m (28 ft), weighing 7.5 tonnes (7.4 long tons; 8.3 short tons). Calves at birth weigh about 180 kg (400 lb) and are about 2.4 m (7.9 ft) long. The killer whale\'s large size and strength make it among the fastest marine mammals, able to reach speeds in excess of 56 km/h (30 kn). The skeleton of the killer whale is of the typical delphinid structure, but is more robust. Its integument, unlike that of most other dolphin species, is characterised by a well-developed dermal layer with a dense network of fascicles of collagen fibers.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Killer whale pectoral fins, analogous to forelimbs, are large and rounded, resembling paddles. Males have significantly larger pectoral fins than females. At about 1.8 m (5.9 ft) the male\'s dorsal fin is more than twice the size of the female\'s and is more of a triangular shape—a tall, elongated isosceles triangle—whereas hers is shorter and more curved. Males and females also have different patterns of black and white skin in their genital areas. Sexual dimorphism is also apparent in the skull; adult males have longer lower jaws than females, and have larger occipital crests.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">An individual killer whale can often be identified from its dorsal fin and saddle patch. Variations such as nicks, scratches, and tears on the dorsal fin and the pattern of white or grey in the saddle patch are unique. Published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification has enabled the local population of killer whales to be counted each year rather than estimated, and has enabled great insight into lifecycles and social structures.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Occasionally a killer whale is white; they have been spotted in the northern Bering Sea and around St. Lawrence Island, and near the Russian coast. In February 2008, a white killer whale was photographed 3.2 km (2.0 mi) off Kanaga Volcano in the Aleutian Islands. In 2010, the Far East Russia Orca Project (FEROP), co-founded and co-directed by Alexander M. Burdin and Erich Hoyt, filmed an adult male nicknamed Iceberg .</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Killer whales have good eyesight above and below the water, excellent hearing, and a good sense of touch. They have exceptionally sophisticated echolocation abilities, detecting the location and characteristics of prey and other objects in their environments by emitting clicks and listening for echoes, as do other members of the dolphin family.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The mean body temperature of the orca is 36 to 38 °C (97 to 100 °F). Like most marine mammals, orcas have a layer of insulating blubber ranging from 7.6 to 10 cm (3.0 to 3.9 in) thick beneath its skin.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The heart beats at a rate of about 60 beats/min when the orca is at the surface, dropping to 30 beats/min when submerged.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Life cycle</strong><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFemale killer whales begin to mature at around the age of 10 (reaching peak fertility around 20), which consists of periods of polyestrous cycling with noncycling periods of between three and 16 months. Females can often breed until age 40, after which comes a rapid decrease in fertility. As such, orcas are among the animals that undergo menopause and live for decades after they have finished breeding. The lifespans of wild females average 50 years. An exception is Granny (J2), who was the oldest known orca, estimated to have been 105 years old at the time of her death.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">To avoid inbreeding, males mate with females from other pods. Gestation varies from 15 to 18 months.  Mothers calve, with usually a single offspring, about once every five years. In resident pods, births occur at any time of year, although winter is the most common. Mortality is extremely high during the first seven months of life, when 37–50% of all calves die. Weaning begins at about 12 months and completes by the age of two. According to observations in several regions, all male and female pod members participate in the care of the young.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Males sexually mature at the age of 15, but do not typically reproduce until age 21. Wild males live around 29 years on average, with a maximum of about 60 years.One male, known as Old Tom, was reportedly spotted every winter between the 1840s and 1930 off New South Wales, Australia. This would have made him up to 90 years old. Examination of his teeth indicated he died around age 35, but this method of age determination is now believed to be inaccurate for older animals. One male known to researchers in the Pacific Northwest (identified as J1) was estimated to have been 59 years old when he died in 2010.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Captive killer whale lifespans are typically significantly shorter, usually less than 25 years; however, numerous individuals are alive in their 30s, and a few have reached their 40s. Killer whales are unique among cetaceans, as their heads become relatively shorter as they age, i.e., the orca\'s caudal section enlongates more-so relative to its head.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Range and habitat</strong><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKiller whales are found in all oceans and most seas. Due to their enormous range, numbers, and density, distributional estimates are difficult to compare, but they clearly prefer higher latitudes and coastal areas over pelagic environments.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Systematic surveys indicate the highest densities of killer whales (&gt;0.40 individuals per 100 km²) in the northeast Atlantic around the Norwegian coast, in the north Pacific along the Aleutian Islands, the Gulf of Alaska and in the Southern Ocean off much of the coast of Antarctica. They are considered \\"common\\" (0.20–0.40 individuals per 100 km²) in the eastern Pacific along the coasts of British Columbia, Washington and Oregon, in the North Atlantic Ocean around Iceland and the Faroe Islands. High densities have also been reported but not quantified in the western North Pacific around the Sea of Japan (in very limited areas and more abundant on the side of Primorsky Krai), Shiretoko Peninsula and off Kushiro (Resident and Transient groups began colonizing in these areas possibly after in 2000s), Sea of Okhotsk, Kuril Islands, Kamchatka and the Commander Islands and in the Southern Hemisphere off the coasts of South Australia, off the coast of northern to southern Brazil and the tip of southern Africa. They are reported as seasonally common in the Canadian Arctic, including Baffin Bay between Greenland and Nunavut, and around Tasmania and Macquarie Island. The northwest Atlantic population of at least 67 individuals ranges from Labrador and Newfoundland to New England with sightings to Cape Cod and Long Island.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Information for offshore regions and tropical waters is more scarce, but widespread, if not frequent, sightings indicate the killer whale can survive in most water temperatures. They have been sighted, for example, in the Mediterranean, the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the Indian Ocean around the Seychelles. In the Mediterranean, killer whales are considered \\"visitors\\" with the exception of one small population which lives in the Strait of Gibraltar. Except for northeastern basins from Black Sea, records have been among almost entire basin including Aegean and Levantine basins such as off Israel. A distinct population may also exist in Papua New Guinea. Distributions and abundances in other Asian waters are very unclear, only with sightings time to time have been reported, such as off Phuket and Mergui Archipelago.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Population structure in mid to lower latitudes of the North Pacific is unclear especially in coastal waters. Large concentrations are known to occur north of the Northern Mariana Islands and in the Gulf of Sendai, and repeated sightings are reported off Bali, the east coast of Taiwan, Ryukyu Islands, Izu Islands, in Tsushima Strait, and Izu Peninsula. The modern status of the species along coastal mainland China and its vicinity is unknown. Recorded sightings have been made from almost the entire shoreline; from Bohai and the Yellow Sea in the north to the Zhoushan Islands in the east and the Vietnam coast in the south.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In the Antarctic, killer whales range up to the edge of the pack ice and are believed to venture into the denser pack ice, finding open leads much like beluga whales in the Arctic. However, killer whales are merely seasonal visitors to Arctic waters, and do not approach the pack ice in the summer. With the rapid Arctic sea ice decline in the Hudson Strait, their range now extends deep into the northwest Atlantic. Occasionally, killer whales swim into freshwater rivers. They have been documented 100 mi (160 km) up the Columbia River in the United States. They have also been found in the Fraser River in Canada and the Horikawa River in Japan.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Migration patterns are poorly understood. Each summer, the same individuals appear off the coasts of British Columbia and Washington. Despite decades of research, where these animals go for the rest of the year remains unknown. Transient pods have been sighted from southern Alaska to central California.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Population</strong><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWorldwide population estimates are uncertain, but recent consensus suggests an absolute minimum of 50,000. Local estimates include roughly 25,000 in the Antarctic, 8,500 in the tropical Pacific, 2,250–2,700 off the cooler northeast Pacific and 500–1,500 off Norway. Japan\'s Fisheries Agency estimated 2,321 killer whales were in the seas around Japan.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Feeding</strong><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKiller whales are apex predators, meaning that they themselves have no natural predators. They are sometimes called the wolves of the sea, because they hunt in groups like wolf packs. Killer whales hunt varied prey including fish, cephalopods, mammals, sea birds and sea turtles. However, different populations or species tend to specialize and some can have a dramatic impact on certain prey species. Those that feed on mammals may not even recognize fish as food. This specialization in diet and hunting is another reason to suggest that the orca is in fact several species, as discussed above.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Fish</em><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFish-eating killer whales prey on around 30 species of fish. Some populations in the Norwegian and Greenland sea specialize in herring and follow that fish\'s autumnal migration to the Norwegian coast. Salmon account for 96% of northeast Pacific residents\' diet. About 65% of them are large, fatty Chinook. Chum salmon are also eaten, but smaller sockeye and pink salmon are not a significant food item. Depletion of specific prey species in an area is, therefore, cause for concern for local populations, despite the high diversity of prey. On average, a killer whale eats 227 kilograms (500 lb) each day. While salmon are usually hunted by an individual or a small group of individuals, herring are often caught using carousel feeding; the killer whales force the herring into a tight ball by releasing bursts of bubbles or flashing their white undersides. They then slap the ball with their tail flukes, either stunning or killing up to 15 fish at a time. The herring are then eaten one at a time. Carousel feeding has only been documented in the Norwegian killer whale population and with some oceanic dolphin species.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In New Zealand, sharks and rays appear to be important prey; species taken include eagle rays, long-tail and short-tail stingrays, common threshers, smooth hammerheads, blue sharks and shortfin mako sharks. With sharks, orcas may herd them to the surface and strike them with their tail flukes, while bottom-dwelling rays are cornered, pinned to the ground and taken to the surface. Killer whales can induce tonic immobility in sharks and rays by holding them upside down, rendering them helpless and incapable of injuring the whale. Some sharks suffocate within about 15 minutes while the whale holds them still, because these sharks need to move to breathe. In one incident filmed near the Farallon Islands in October 1997, a 4.7–5.3-metre (15–17 ft) female killed a 3–4-metre (9.8–13.1 ft) great white shark, apparently after swimming with it upside-down in her mouth and inducing tonic immobility in it. She and another pod member ate the shark\'s liver and allowed the rest of the carcass to sink. In February 2015, a pod of orcas was recorded to have killed a white shark off South Australia. Interspecific competition between the two species is probable in regions where dietary preferences overlap. In July 1992, two killer whales attacked, killed and fed on an 8-metre (26 ft) long whale shark, Rhincodon typus, in the waters off Bahia de los Angeles in Baja California.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Mammals</em><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKiller whales are very sophisticated and effective predators of marine mammals. Thirty-two cetacean species have been recorded as prey, from observing orcas\' feeding activity, examining the stomach contents of dead orcas, and seeing scars on the bodies of surviving prey animals. Groups even attack larger cetaceans such as minke whales, gray whales, and rarely sperm whales or blue whales.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Hunting large whales usually takes several hours. Killer whales generally choose to attack young or weak animals; however, a group of five or more may attack a healthy adult. When hunting a young whale, a group chases it and its mother until they wear out. Eventually, they separate the pair and surround the calf, preventing it from surfacing to breathe, drowning it. Pods of female sperm whales sometimes protect themselves by forming a protective circle around their calves with their flukes facing outwards, using them to repel the attackers. Rarely, large killer whale pods can overwhelm even adult female sperm whales. Adult bull sperm whales, which are large, powerful and aggressive when threatened, and fully grown adult blue whales, which are possibly too large to overwhelm, are not believed to be prey for killer whales.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Prior to the advent of industrial whaling, great whales may have been the major food source for killer whales. The introduction of modern whaling techniques may have aided killer whales by the sound of exploding harpoons indicating availability of prey to scavenge, and compressed air inflation of whale carcasses causing them to float, thus exposing them to scavenging. However, the toll on great whale populations by unfettered whaling had possibly reduced their availability as prey for killer whales, and caused them to expand their consumption of smaller marine mammals, thus contributing to their decline as well.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Predation by orcas on whale calves in high productivity, high latitude areas has been hypothesised to be the reason for great whale migrations to low productivity tropical waters, to reduce the risk of attacks on the highly vulnerable calves due to lower density of orcas in these waters.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Other marine mammal prey species include nearly 20 species of seal, sea lion and fur seal. Walruses and sea otters are less frequently taken. Often, to avoid injury, killer whales disable their prey before killing and eating it. This may involve throwing it in the air, slapping it with their tails, ramming it, or breaching and landing on it. Sea lions are killed by head-butting or after a stunning blow from a tail fluke. In the Aleutian Islands, a decline in sea otter populations in the 1990s was controversially attributed by some scientists to killer whale predation, although with no direct evidence. The decline of sea otters followed a decline in harbour seal and Steller sea lion populations, the killer whale\'s preferred prey, which in turn may be substitutes for their original prey, now decimated by industrial whaling.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In steeply banked beaches off Península Valdés, Argentina, and the Crozet Islands, killer whales feed on South American sea lions and southern elephant seals in shallow water, even beaching temporarily to grab prey before wriggling back to the sea. Beaching, usually fatal to cetaceans, is not an instinctive behaviour, and can require years of practice for the young. Killer whales can then release the animal near juvenile whales, allowing the younger whales to practice the difficult capture technique on the now-weakened prey. \\"Wave-hunting\\" killer whales spy-hop to locate Weddell seals, crabeater seals, leopard seals, and penguins resting on ice floes, and then swim in groups to create waves that wash over the floe. This washes the prey into the water, where other killer whales lie in wait.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Killer whales have also been observed preying on terrestrial mammals, such as deer swimming between islands off the northwest coast of North America. Killer whale cannibalism has also been reported based on analysis of stomach contents, but this is likely to be the result of scavenging remains dumped by whalers. One killer whale was also attacked by its companions after being shot. Although resident killer whales have never been observed to eat other marine mammals, they occasionally harass and kill porpoises and seals for no apparent reason.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Birds</em><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKiller whales in many areas may prey on cormorants and gulls. A captive killer whale at MarineLand discovered it could regurgitate fish onto the surface, attracting sea gulls, and then eat the birds. Four others then learned to copy the behaviour.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Behaviour</strong><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDay-to-day killer whale behaviour generally consists of foraging, travelling, resting and socializing. Killer whales engage in frequent behaviour at the surface such as breaching (jumping completely out of the water) and tail-slapping. These activities may have a variety of purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodging parasites, or play. Spyhopping, a behaviour in which a whale holds its head above water, helps the animal view its surroundings.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Resident killer whales swim with porpoises, other dolphins, seals, and sea lions, which are common prey for transient killer whales.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Social structure</em><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKiller whales are notable for their complex societies. Only elephants and higher primates, such as humans, live in comparably complex social structures. Due to orcas\' complex social bonds and society, many marine experts have concerns about how humane it is to keep these animals in captive situations.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Resident killer whales in the eastern North Pacific have a particularly complex and stable social grouping system. Unlike any other mammal species whose social structure is known, residents live with their mothers for their entire lives. These family groups are based on matrilines consisting of the eldest female (matriarch) and her sons and daughters, and the descendants of her daughters, etc. The average size of a matriline is 5.5 animals. Because females can reach age 90, as many as four generations travel together. These matrilineal groups are highly stable. Individuals separate for only a few hours at a time, to mate or forage. With one exception, the killer whale named Luna, no permanent separation of an individual from a resident matriline has been recorded.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Closely related matrilines form loose aggregations called pods, usually consisting of one to four matrilines. Unlike matrilines, pods may separate for weeks or months at a time. DNA testing indicates resident males nearly always mate with females from other pods. Clans, the next level of resident social structure, are composed of pods with similar dialects, and common but older maternal heritage. Clan ranges overlap, mingling pods from different clans. The final association layer, perhaps more arbitrarily defined than the familial groupings, is called the community, and is defined as a set of clans that regularly commingle. Clans within a community do not share vocal patterns.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Transient pods are smaller than resident pods, typically consisting of an adult female and one or two of her offspring. Males typically maintain stronger relationships with their mothers than other females. These bonds can extend well into adulthood. Unlike residents, extended or permanent separation of transient offspring from natal matrilines is common, with juveniles and adults of both sexes participating. Some males become \\"rovers\\" and do not form long-term associations, occasionally joining groups that contain reproductive females. As in resident clans, transient community members share an acoustic repertoire, although regional differences in vocalizations have been noted.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Vocalizations</em><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLike all cetaceans, killer whales depend heavily on underwater sound for orientation, feeding, and communication. They produce three categories of sounds: clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls. Clicks are believed to be used primarily for navigation and discriminating prey and other objects in the surrounding environment, but are also commonly heard during social interactions.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Northeast Pacific resident groups tend to be much more vocal than transient groups in the same waters. Residents feed primarily on Chinook and chum salmon, species that are insensitive to killer whale calls (inferred from the audiogram of Atlantic salmon). In contrast, the marine mammal prey of transients hear well underwater at the frequencies used in killer whale calls. As such, transients are typically silent, probably to avoid alerting their mammalian prey. They sometimes use a single click (called a cryptic click) rather than the long train of clicks observed in other populations. Residents are only silent when resting.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">All members of a resident pod use similar calls, known collectively as a dialect. Dialects are composed of specific numbers and types of discrete, repetitive calls. They are complex and stable over time. Call patterns and structure are distinctive within matrilines. Newborns produce calls similar to their mothers, but have a more limited repertoire. Individuals likely learn their dialect through contact with their mother and other pod members. For instance, family-specific calls have been observed more frequently in the days following a calf\'s birth, which may help the calf learn them. Dialects are probably an important means of maintaining group identity and cohesiveness. Similarity in dialects likely reflects the degree of relatedness between pods, with variation building over time. When pods meet, dominant call types decrease and subset call types increase. The use of both call types is called biphonation. The increased subset call types may be the distinguishing factor between pods and inter-pod relations.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Dialects of killer whales not only distinguish them between pods, but also between types. Resident dialects contain seven to 17 (mean = 11) distinctive call types. All members of the North American west coast transient community express the same basic dialect, although minor regional variation in call types is evident. Preliminary research indicates offshore killer whales have group-specific dialects unlike those of residents and transients.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The vocalizations of killer whales in other parts of the world have also been studied. Norwegian and Icelandic herring-eating orcas appear to have different vocalizations for activities like hunting and traveling.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Intelligence</strong><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKiller whales have the second-heaviest brains among marine mammals (after sperm whales, which have the largest brain of any animal). They can be trained in captivity and are often described as intelligent, although defining and measuring \\"intelligence\\" is difficult in a species whose environment and behavioural strategies are very different from those of humans.</p>\\n<div>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Killer whales imitate others, and seem to deliberately teach skills to their kin. Off the Crozet Islands, mothers push their calves onto the beach, waiting to pull the youngster back if needed.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">People who have interacted closely with killer whales offer numerous anecdotes demonstrating the whales\' curiosity, playfulness, and ability to solve problems. Alaskan killer whales have not only learned how to steal fish from longlines, but have also overcome a variety of techniques designed to stop them, such as the use of unbaited lines as decoys. Once, fishermen placed their boats several miles apart, taking turns retrieving small amounts of their catch, in the hope that the whales would not have enough time to move between boats to steal the catch as it was being retrieved. A researcher described what happened next:</p>\\n<blockquote><p class=\\"rtejustify\\">It worked really well for a while. Then the whales split into two groups. It didn\'t even take them an hour to figure it out. They were so thrilled when they figured out what was going on, that we were playing games. They were breaching by the boats.<br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t— Craig Matkin</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In other anecdotes, researchers describe incidents in which wild killer whales playfully tease humans by repeatedly moving objects the humans are trying to reach, or suddenly start to toss around a chunk of ice after a human throws a snowball.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The killer whale\'s use of dialects and the passing of other learned behaviours from generation to generation have been described as a form of animal culture.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The complex and stable vocal and behavioural cultures of sympatric groups of killer whales (Orcinus orca) appear to have no parallel outside humans and represent an independent evolution of cultural faculties.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Conservation<br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn 2008, the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) changed its assessment of the killer whale\'s conservation status from conservation dependent to data deficient, recognizing that one or more killer whale types may actually be separate, endangered species. Depletion of prey species, pollution, large-scale oil spills, and habitat disturbance caused by noise and conflicts with boats are currently the most significant worldwide threats.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Like other animals at the highest trophic levels, the killer whale is particularly at risk of poisoning from bioaccumulation of toxins, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). European harbour seals have problems in reproductive and immune functions associated with high levels of PCBs and related contaminants, and a survey off the Washington coast found PCB levels in killer whales were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbour seals. Blubber samples in the Norwegian Arctic show higher levels of PCBs, pesticides and brominated flame-retardants than in polar bears. When food is scarce, killer whales metabolize blubber for energy, which increases pollutant concentrations in their blood.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In the Pacific Northwest, wild salmon stocks, a main resident food source, have declined dramatically in recent years. On the west coast of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, seal and sea lion populations have also substantially declined.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In 2005, the United States government listed the southern resident community as an endangered population under the Endangered Species Act. This community comprises three pods which live mostly in the Georgia and Haro Straits and Puget Sound in British Columbia and Washington. They do not breed outside of their community, which was once estimated at around 200 animals and later shrank to around 90. In October 2008, the annual survey revealed seven were missing and presumed dead, reducing the count to 83. This is potentially the largest decline in the population in the past ten years. These deaths can be attributed to declines in Chinook salmon.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Scientist Ken Balcomb has extensively studied killer whales since 1976; he is the research biologist responsible for discovering U.S. Navy sonar may harm killer whales. He studied killer whales from the Center for Whale Research, located in Friday Harbor, Washington. He was also able to study killer whales from \\"his home porch perched above Puget Sound, where the animals hunt and play in summer months\\". In May 2003, Balcomb (along with other whale watchers near the Puget Sound coastline) noticed uncharacteristic behaviour displayed by the killer whales. The whales seemed \\"agitated and were moving haphazardly, attempting to lift their heads free of the water\\" to escape the sound of the sonars. \\"Balcomb confirmed at the time that strange underwater pinging noises detected with underwater microphones were sonar. The sound originated from a U.S. Navy frigate 12 miles (19 kilometers) distant, Balcomb said.\\" The impact of sonar waves on killer whales is potentially life-threatening. Three years prior to Balcomb\'s discovery, research in the Bahamas showed 14 beaked whales washed up on the shore. These whales were beached on the day U.S. Navy destroyers were activated into sonar exercise. Of the 14 whales beached, six of them died. These six dead whales were studied, and CAT scans of two of the whale heads showed hemorrhaging around the brain and the ears, which is consistent with decompression sickness.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Another conservation concern was made public in September 2008 when the Canadian government decided it was not necessary to enforce further protections (including the Species at Risk Act in place to protect endangered animals along their habitats) for killer whales aside from the laws already in place. In response to this decision, six environmental groups sued the federal government, claiming killer whales were facing many threats on the British Columbia Coast and the federal government did nothing to protect them from these threats. A legal and scientific nonprofit organization, Ecojustice, led the lawsuit and represented the David Suzuki Foundation, Environmental Defence, Greenpeace Canada, International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Raincoast Conservation Foundation, and the Wilderness Committee. Many scientists involved in this lawsuit, including Bill Wareham, a marine scientist with the David Suzuki Foundation, noted increased boat traffic, water toxic wastes, and low salmon population as major threats, putting approximately 87 killer whales on the British Columbia Coast in danger.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Underwater noise from shipping, drilling, and other human activities is a significant concern in some key killer whale habitats, including Johnstone Strait and Haro Strait. In the mid-1990s, loud underwater noises from salmon farms were used to deter seals. Killer whales also avoided the surrounding waters. High-intensity sonar used by the Navy disturbs killer whales along with other marine mammals. Killer whales are popular with whale watchers, which may stress the whales and alter their behaviour, particularly if boats approach too closely or block their lines of travel.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The Exxon Valdez oil spill adversely affected killer whales in Prince William Sound and Alaska\'s Kenai Fjords region. Eleven members (about half) of one resident pod disappeared in the following year. The spill damaged salmon and other prey populations, which in turn damaged local killer whales. By 2009, scientists estimated the AT1 transient population (considered part of a larger population of 346 transients), numbered only seven individuals and had not reproduced since the spill. This population is expected to die out.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Relationship with humans</strong><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<em>Indigenous cultures</em><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast feature killer whales throughout their art, history, spirituality and religion. The Haida regarded killer whales as the most powerful animals in the ocean, and their mythology tells of killer whales living in houses and towns under the sea. According to these myths, they took on human form when submerged, and humans who drowned went to live with them. For the Kwakwaka\'wakw, the killer whale was regarded as the ruler of the undersea world, with sea lions for slaves and dolphins for warriors. In Nuu-chah-nulth and Kwakwaka\'wakw mythology, killer whales may embody the souls of deceased chiefs. The Tlingit of southeastern Alaska regarded the killer whale as custodian of the sea and a benefactor of humans.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The Maritime Archaic people of Newfoundland also had great respect for killer whales, as evidenced by stone carvings found in a 4,000-year-old burial at the Port au Choix Archaeological Site.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In the tales and beliefs of the Siberian Yupik people, killer whales are said to appear as wolves in winter, and wolves as killer whales in summer. Killer whales are believed to assist their hunters in driving walrus. Reverence is expressed in several forms: the boat represents the animal, and a wooden carving hung from the hunter\'s belt. Small sacrifices such as tobacco are strewn into the sea for them. Killer whales were believed to have helped the hunters even when in wolf guise, by forcing reindeer to allow themselves to be killed.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>\\"Killer\\" stereotype</em><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn Western cultures, killer whales were historically feared as dangerous, savage predators. The first written description of a killer whale was given by Pliny the Elder circa AD 70, who wrote, \\"Orcas (the appearance of which no image can express, other than an enormous mass of savage flesh with teeth) are the enemy of [other whales]... they charge and pierce them like warships ramming.\\"</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Of the very few confirmed attacks on humans by wild killer whales, none have been fatal. In one instance, killer whales tried to tip ice floes on which a dog team and photographer of the Terra Nova Expedition was standing. The sled dogs\' barking is speculated to have sounded enough like seal calls to trigger the killer whale\'s hunting curiosity. In the 1970s, a surfer in California was bitten, and in 2005, a boy in Alaska who was splashing in a region frequented by harbor seals was bumped by a killer whale that apparently misidentified him as prey. Unlike wild killer whales, captive killer whales are reported to have made nearly two dozen attacks on humans since the 1970s, some of which have been fatal.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Competition with fishermen also led to killer whales being regarded as pests. In the waters of the Pacific Northwest and Iceland, the shooting of killer whales was accepted and even encouraged by governments. As an indication of the intensity of shooting that occurred until fairly recently, about 25% of the killer whales captured in Puget Sound for aquaria through 1970 bore bullet scars. The U.S. Navy claimed to have deliberately killed hundreds of killer whales in Icelandic waters in 1956 with machine-guns, rockets, and depth charges.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Modern Western attitudes</em><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWestern attitudes towards killer whales have changed dramatically in recent decades. In the mid-1960s and early 1970s, killer whales came to much greater public and scientific awareness, starting with the first live-capture and display of a killer whale known as Moby Doll, a resident harpooned off Saturna Island in 1964. So little was known at the time, it was nearly two months before the whale\'s keepers discovered what food (fish) it was willing to eat. To the surprise of those who saw him, Moby Doll was a docile, nonaggressive whale that made no attempts to attack humans.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Between 1964 and 1976, 50 killer whales from the Pacific Northwest were captured for display in aquaria, and public interest in the animals grew. In the 1970s, research pioneered by Michael Bigg led to the discovery of the species\' complex social structure, its use of vocal communication, and its extraordinarily stable mother–offspring bonds. Through photo-identification techniques, individuals were named and tracked over decades.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Bigg\'s techniques also revealed the Pacific Northwest population was in the low hundreds rather than the thousands that had been previously assumed. The southern resident community alone had lost 48 of its members to captivity; by 1976, only 80 remained. In the Pacific Northwest, the species that had unthinkingly been targeted became a cultural icon within a few decades.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The public\'s growing appreciation also led to growing opposition to whale–keeping in aquaria. Only one whale has been taken in North American waters since 1976. In recent years, the extent of the public\'s interest in killer whales has manifested itself in several high-profile efforts surrounding individuals. Following the success of the 1993 film Free Willy, the movie\'s captive star Keiko was returned to the coast of his native Iceland in 1998. The director of the International Marine Mammal Project for the Earth Island Institute, David Phillips, led the efforts to return Keiko to the Iceland waters. In 2002 the orphan Springer was discovered in Puget Sound, Washington. She became the first whale to be successfully reintegrated into a wild pod after human intervention, crystallizing decades of research into the vocal behaviour and social structure of the region\'s killer whales. The saving of Springer raised hopes that another young killer whale named Luna, which had become separated from his pod, could be returned to it. However, his case was marked by controversy about whether and how to intervene, and in 2006, Luna was killed by a boat propeller.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Whaling</em><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tA killer whale swims alongside a whaling boat, with a smaller whale in between. Two men are standing, the harpooner in the bow and a steersman on the aft rudder, while four oarsmen are seated.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The killer whale named Old Tom swims alongside a whaleboat, flanking a whale calf. The boat is being towed by a harpooned whale, near Eden, Australia.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The earlier of known records of commercial hunting of killer whales date to the 18th century in Japan. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the global whaling industry caught immense numbers of baleen and sperm whales, but largely ignored killer whales because of their limited amounts of recoverable oil, their smaller populations, and the difficulty of taking them. Once the stocks of larger species were depleted, killer whales were targeted by commercial whalers in the mid-20th century. Between 1954 and 1997, Japan took 1,178 killer whales (although the Ministry of the Environment claims that there had been domestic catches of about 1,600 whales between late 1940s to 1960s) and Norway took 987. Over 3,000 killer whales were taken by Soviet whalers, including an Antarctic catch of 916 in 1979–80 alone, prompting the International Whaling Commission to recommend a ban on commercial hunting of the species pending further research. (Compare with the situation on land, Commercial hunting.) Today, no country carries out a substantial hunt, although Indonesia and Greenland permit small subsistence hunts (see Aboriginal whaling). Other than commercial hunts, killer whales were hunted along Japanese coasts out of public concern for potential conflicts with fisheries. Such cases include a semi-resident male-female pair in Akashi Strait and Harimanada being killed in the Seto Inland Sea in 1957, the killing of five whales from a pod of 11 members that swam into Tokyo Bay in 1970, and a catch record in southern Taiwan in the 1990s.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Cooperation with humans</em><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tKiller whales have helped humans hunting other whales. One well-known example was the killer whales of Eden, Australia, including the male known as Old Tom. Whalers more often considered them a nuisance, however, as orcas would gather to scavenge meat from the whalers\' catch. Some populations, such as in Alaska\'s Prince William Sound, may have been reduced significantly by whalers shooting them in retaliation.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Captivity</em><br />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe killer whale\'s intelligence, trainability, striking appearance, playfulness in captivity and sheer size have made it a popular exhibit at aquaria and aquatic theme parks. From 1976 to 1997, 55 whales were taken from the wild in Iceland, 19 from Japan, and three from Argentina. These figures exclude animals that died during capture. Live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Organizations such as World Animal Protection and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society campaign against the practice of keeping them in captivity. In captivity, they often develop pathologies, such as the dorsal fin collapse seen in 60–90% of captive males. Captives have vastly reduced life expectancies, on average only living into their 20s. In the wild, females who survive infancy live 46 years on average, and up to 70–80 years in rare cases. Wild males who survive infancy live 31 years on average, and up to 50–60 years. Captivity usually bears little resemblance to wild habitat, and captive whales\' social groups are foreign to those found in the wild. Critics claim captive life is stressful due to these factors and the requirement to perform circus tricks that are not part of wild killer whale behaviour, see above. Wild killer whales may travel up to 160 kilometres (100 mi) in a day, and critics say the animals are too big and intelligent to be suitable for captivity. Captives occasionally act aggressively towards themselves, their tankmates, or humans, which critics say is a result of stress. Between 1991 and 2010, the bull orca known as Tilikum was involved in the death of three people, and was featured in the critically acclaimed 2013 film, Blackfish Tilikum has lived at SeaWorld since 1992.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">A 2015 study coauthored by staff at SeaWorld and the Minnesota Zoo indicates that there is no significant difference in survivorship between free-ranging and captive killer whales. The authors speculate about the future utility of studying captive populations for the purposes of understanding orca biology and the implications of such research of captive animals in the overall health of both wild and marine park populations. The study has been criticised by Dr Trevor Willis, senior lecture in marine biology at the University of Portsmouth, who stated that the study is misleading, \\"clearly wrong\\" and indicative of \\"poor practice\\". He said that this is the case because it compares swimming pools to the wild ocean and the extrapolates the survival rates of calves to life expectancy in adulthood.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">As of March 2016, SeaWorld has announced that they will be ending their orca breeding program and their theatrical shows. They previously announced, in November 2015, that the shows would be coming to an end in San Diego but it is now to happen in both Orlando and San Antonio as well.</p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<hr />\\n<p>References:</p>\\n<p><a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_whale\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Wikipedia</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\\"http://www.nature.com/news/scientists-clash-over-lifespan-of-captive-killer-whales-1.19623?WT.ec_id=NEWSDAILY-20170109\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Nature</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<p> </p>\\n",

Apidae is the largest family of bees, consisting of the only species of bees used by humans for honey consumption. B. polaris is part of the subgenus Alpinobombus along with Bombus alpinus, Bombus balteatus, Bombus hyperboreus, and Bombus neoboreus. Alpinobombus bees occur in arctic and high alpine regions. It is of the Bombini tribe, which feeds on pollen or nectar.</p>\\r\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Description and identification</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t<u>Appearance (General)</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tBombus polaris has a thicker coat of hair than temperate bees in order to slow heat loss. Although the coloration of this bee is variable, the thorax is usually black with orange-yellow edges, while most of the abdomen is orange-yellow with a black tip. B. polaris also has a higher abdominal temperature than its temperate cousins.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Appearance (Workers)</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe variation in the color of the pubescence is noticeable variable. The pubescence of the apical dorsal abdominal segments varies from deep rust color to a dull yellow color. There is also a considerable variation in the size of the workers. Some can be scarcely 10 mm in length, while others can be much larger.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Thermoregulation</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tAdditionally, B. polaris has a bio-mechanical method of bringing its body to a much higher abdominal temperature than its temperate relatives. The ability of B. polaris to fly in deep cold is due to a process called thermoregulation, which allows it to raise its internal body temperature to temperatures as high as 38 °C. For this reason B. polaris is likely to outcompete any temperate bumblebee species that might seek to expand to the northern range.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Nests</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe nests are heavily insulated, which is an important factor in the bees’ energy conservation in the harsh polar environment. At the start of the colony cycle, the lone queen maintains a nest temperature of about 25-30 °C However, when she makes foraging trips at frequent intervals, the temperature of the nest will decline. At an air temperature of 10 °C, the nest temperature generally does not decline more than 7 °C in the half hour that the queen is foraging. After all of the sixteen to seventeen larvae of the first brood have developed into workers, the nest temperature is maintained at a steady 35 °C, and the comings and going of the queen and other foragers does not appear to affect the nest temperature. The nest of Bombus polaris also appears to have a higher nest temperature than those of honeybees and bumblebees from temperature climates.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Nest structure</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tFirst, a fertilized queen must locate a suitable nesting site. After this, she will build a cell to hold the food and provisions, and then a hatch camera to house her offspring. B. polaris queens will use a mixture of pollen and wax to build these initial structures. First the hatch camera will be constructed, followed shortly afterwards by the construction of a wax base. On top of this base, the queen will deposit a dust clump, which she will have covered in flower nectar. This will be ringed by a wax roller. She will then lay her eggs into the clump, pour them with a dust mixture, and then cover it with a wax membrane.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThis bumblebee has a wide circumpolar distribution, found in Canada, Arctic Alaska, Arctic islands (Devon Island, Ellesmere Island, Baffin Island and Greenland), northern Scandinavia and across Arctic Russia (Nenets, Yamalo-Nenets, Sakha and Chukotka). As of 2015, B. polaris is common and is not listed as endangered. Bombus polaris is an alpine species. They exclusively live at the summits of mountains. This clear separation between alpine species and subalpine species may be due to superior competition from the subalpine species, leading to a suboptimal habitat occupation of the alpine species. An alternative explanation is that the alpine bee species possess both the ability and body type to survive the colder temperatures, which naturally separates the two types of bees into distinct ecological territories. Alpine species usually have a larger body length in comparison to subalpine species.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Colony cycle</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t<u>Colony initiation</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tA Bombus polaris queens hibernate for about nine months, suspended in an almost lifeless state in a mouse nest or some other subterranean burrow. She will wait for the ground to warm. After this, B. polaris fertilized queens emerge from hibernation, visiting flowers and looking for areas to build potential nests. This signals the start of the seasonal cycle of development. Recently started colonies can be found in June or July.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Colony growth</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tB. polaris is a social bee that requires a completion of at least two generations every year. To make up for this short amount of time, the queens produce many workers per generation. The initial brood is a clutch of around twenty larvae that emerge in about ten days. Arctic bumblebee larvae grow fast, and will experience a near tropical environment due to the heat production of their queen, and later on, of the workers.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Arctic bumblebees have a larger initial brood as an adaptation to speed up the colony cycle in the very short growing season. Since the queen has time to produce only a few broods, she must also lay very large egg clutches. The life cycle is sped up by incubating the eggs internally that are already in the abdomen, thus increasing the rate of egg production and egg growth.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Behavior</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t<u>Foraging</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tBombus polaris is one of the few bumblebee species where the queen will continue to forage while some workers have already emerged in the nest. She divides her time between incubating her brood and regulating the temperature of the nest to leaving the nest to forage. The food reserves gathered in the day are generally sufficient for only one night. When the bees exhaust their food, they enter torpor and cease to incubate. Occasional periods of semi-starvation lasting for a day or two do not harm the colony. The bees simply become drowsy and remain in a state of suspended animation.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Life history and survivorship curves</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t<u>Colonies</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe colony begins in the summer in June. The colony is only able to survive for two or three months until winter hits again. All workers, drones, and most females die with the colony.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Workers</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe queen’s first brood after the start of the colony will develop into worker bees – small sterile females who will enlarge the nest, forage, and tend to the next generation of bees. Worker bees will die along with the colony at the beginning of winter.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Queens</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe queen is the sole survivor of her colony after 9 months of hibernation during the winter. In the Arctic, only one queen per colony on average will survive the winter to renew the next life cycle. The colony only has one or two months to complete the social cycle of two generations. The old queen dies with her progeny.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Males</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe queen’s second brood in late summer include male drones and fertile females who are candidates for next year’s queen. The drone’s sole function is to fertilize the females, but most females will die along with the drones at the beginning of winter.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Interaction with other species</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t<u>Diet</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tLarge zygomorphic flowers of Pedicularis are dependent on B. polaris. B. polaris works the spikes of Pedicularis upwards from the bottom. Through this behavior, the adaption of gustatory organs to sugar is offset by the increasing concentration of sugars in the nectar up the spike. This behavior is also significantly related to pollination.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Predators</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tPredators of Bombus polaris include the Buff-breasted sandpiper (Tryngites subruficollis), common eider (Somateria mollissima), and old squaw (Clangula hyemalis), which will either eat the bees or feed them to their young.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Parasites</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tBombus hyperboreus habitually takes over the nests of Bombus polaris. Because of the short Arctic summer, B. polaris normally has time to produce only one brood of workers before the colony has to raise queens. When B. hyperboreus takes over the nest, all of her young are raised as queens by the B. polaris workers. Thus, B. hyperboreus workers are not produced and pollen collectors are never seen.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Human importance</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tDue to its cold tolerance the Bombus polaris appears to be one of the earliest pollinators of vegetation in the Arctic each year. Some plants they pollinate include Arctic poppies, Arctic roses, and Arctic willows. Their pollinator effect seems to be heaviest in the early spring, but decreasing as the year continues. Samuel Robinson has found that, by the time most scientists arrive for the brief warm summers, the \\"Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) and Butterflies and Moths (Lepidoptera) were found to play a minor role in pollination, while flies (Dipterans) were shown to be the major pollinators.\\" &nbsp;One of the leading modern experts on B. polaris, Bernd Heinrich, agrees with this finding, saying that when \\"it gets warm, there’s a lot more fly pollination, and there’s actually some pollination by mosquitoes, as well.\\"</p>\\r\\n\\t<hr />\\r\\n\\tReferences<br />\\r\\n\\t<a href=\\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/11/science/alaska-bumblebee.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=science&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront\\">Wikipedia</a><br />\\r\\n\\t<a href=\\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/11/science/alaska-bumblebee.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=science&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront\\">NY Times</a></div>\\r\\n",

B. polaris also has a higher abdominal temperature than its temperate cousins.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Appearance (Workers)</u><br />\\n\\t\\tThe variation in the color of the pubescence is noticeable variable. The pubescence of the apical dorsal abdominal segments varies from deep rust color to a dull yellow color. There is also a considerable variation in the size of the workers. Some can be scarcely 10 mm in length, while others can be much larger.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Thermoregulation</u><br />\\n\\t\\tAdditionally, B. polaris has a bio-mechanical method of bringing its body to a much higher abdominal temperature than its temperate relatives. The ability of B. polaris to fly in deep cold is due to a process called thermoregulation, which allows it to raise its internal body temperature to temperatures as high as 38 °C. For this reason B. polaris is likely to outcompete any temperate bumblebee species that might seek to expand to the northern range.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Nests</strong><br />\\n\\t\\tThe nests are heavily insulated, which is an important factor in the bees’ energy conservation in the harsh polar environment. At the start of the colony cycle, the lone queen maintains a nest temperature of about 25-30 °C However, when she makes foraging trips at frequent intervals, the temperature of the nest will decline. At an air temperature of 10 °C, the nest temperature generally does not decline more than 7 °C in the half hour that the queen is foraging. After all of the sixteen to seventeen larvae of the first brood have developed into workers, the nest temperature is maintained at a steady 35 °C, and the comings and going of the queen and other foragers does not appear to affect the nest temperature. The nest of Bombus polaris also appears to have a higher nest temperature than those of honeybees and bumblebees from temperature climates.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Nest structure</u><br />\\n\\t\\tFirst, a fertilized queen must locate a suitable nesting site. After this, she will build a cell to hold the food and provisions, and then a hatch camera to house her offspring. B. polaris queens will use a mixture of pollen and wax to build these initial structures. First the hatch camera will be constructed, followed shortly afterwards by the construction of a wax base. On top of this base, the queen will deposit a dust clump, which she will have covered in flower nectar. This will be ringed by a wax roller. She will then lay her eggs into the clump, pour them with a dust mixture, and then cover it with a wax membrane.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong><br />\\n\\t\\tThis bumblebee has a wide circumpolar distribution, found in Canada, Arctic Alaska, Arctic islands (Devon Island, Ellesmere Island, Baffin Island and Greenland), northern Scandinavia and across Arctic Russia (Nenets, Yamalo-Nenets, Sakha and Chukotka). As of 2015, B. polaris is common and is not listed as endangered. Bombus polaris is an alpine species. They exclusively live at the summits of mountains. This clear separation between alpine species and subalpine species may be due to superior competition from the subalpine species, leading to a suboptimal habitat occupation of the alpine species. An alternative explanation is that the alpine bee species possess both the ability and body type to survive the colder temperatures, which naturally separates the two types of bees into distinct ecological territories. Alpine species usually have a larger body length in comparison to subalpine species.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Colony cycle</strong><br />\\n\\t\\t<u>Colony initiation</u><br />\\n\\t\\tA Bombus polaris queens hibernate for about nine months, suspended in an almost lifeless state in a mouse nest or some other subterranean burrow. She will wait for the ground to warm. After this, B. polaris fertilized queens emerge from hibernation, visiting flowers and looking for areas to build potential nests. This signals the start of the seasonal cycle of development. Recently started colonies can be found in June or July.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Colony growth</u><br />\\n\\t\\tB. polaris is a social bee that requires a completion of at least two generations every year. To make up for this short amount of time, the queens produce many workers per generation. The initial brood is a clutch of around twenty larvae that emerge in about ten days. Arctic bumblebee larvae grow fast, and will experience a near tropical environment due to the heat production of their queen, and later on, of the workers.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Arctic bumblebees have a larger initial brood as an adaptation to speed up the colony cycle in the very short growing season. Since the queen has time to produce only a few broods, she must also lay very large egg clutches. The life cycle is sped up by incubating the eggs internally that are already in the abdomen, thus increasing the rate of egg production and egg growth.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Behavior</strong><br />\\n\\t\\t<u>Foraging</u><br />\\n\\t\\tBombus polaris is one of the few bumblebee species where the queen will continue to forage while some workers have already emerged in the nest. She divides her time between incubating her brood and regulating the temperature of the nest to leaving the nest to forage. The food reserves gathered in the day are generally sufficient for only one night. When the bees exhaust their food, they enter torpor and cease to incubate. Occasional periods of semi-starvation lasting for a day or two do not harm the colony. The bees simply become drowsy and remain in a state of suspended animation.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Life history and survivorship curves</strong><br />\\n\\t\\t<u>Colonies</u><br />\\n\\t\\tThe colony begins in the summer in June. The colony is only able to survive for two or three months until winter hits again. All workers, drones, and most females die with the colony.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Workers</u><br />\\n\\t\\tThe queen’s first brood after the start of the colony will develop into worker bees – small sterile females who will enlarge the nest, forage, and tend to the next generation of bees. Worker bees will die along with the colony at the beginning of winter.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Queens</u><br />\\n\\t\\tThe queen is the sole survivor of her colony after 9 months of hibernation during the winter. In the Arctic, only one queen per colony on average will survive the winter to renew the next life cycle. The colony only has one or two months to complete the social cycle of two generations. The old queen dies with her progeny.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Males</u><br />\\n\\t\\tThe queen’s second brood in late summer include male drones and fertile females who are candidates for next year’s queen. The drone’s sole function is to fertilize the females, but most females will die along with the drones at the beginning of winter.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Interaction with other species</strong><br />\\n\\t\\t<u>Diet</u><br />\\n\\t\\tLarge zygomorphic flowers of Pedicularis are dependent on B. polaris. B. polaris works the spikes of Pedicularis upwards from the bottom. Through this behavior, the adaption of gustatory organs to sugar is offset by the increasing concentration of sugars in the nectar up the spike. This behavior is also significantly related to pollination.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Predators</u><br />\\n\\t\\tPredators of Bombus polaris include the Buff-breasted sandpiper (Tryngites subruficollis), common eider (Somateria mollissima), and old squaw (Clangula hyemalis), which will either eat the bees or feed them to their young.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Parasites</u><br />\\n\\t\\tBombus hyperboreus habitually takes over the nests of Bombus polaris. Because of the short Arctic summer, B. polaris normally has time to produce only one brood of workers before the colony has to raise queens. When B. hyperboreus takes over the nest, all of her young are raised as queens by the B. polaris workers. Thus, B. hyperboreus workers are not produced and pollen collectors are never seen.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Human importance</strong><br />\\n\\t\\tDue to its cold tolerance the Bombus polaris appears to be one of the earliest pollinators of vegetation in the Arctic each year. Some plants they pollinate include Arctic poppies, Arctic roses, and Arctic willows. Their pollinator effect seems to be heaviest in the early spring, but decreasing as the year continues. Samuel Robinson has found that, by the time most scientists arrive for the brief warm summers, the \\"Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) and Butterflies and Moths (Lepidoptera) were found to play a minor role in pollination, while flies (Dipterans) were shown to be the major pollinators.\\"  One of the leading modern experts on B. polaris, Bernd Heinrich, agrees with this finding, saying that when \\"it gets warm, there’s a lot more fly pollination, and there’s actually some pollination by mosquitoes, as well.\\"</p>\\n<hr />\\n\\tReferences<br />\\n\\t<a href=\\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/11/science/alaska-bumblebee.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=science&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront\\">Wikipedia</a><br />\\n\\t<a href=\\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/11/science/alaska-bumblebee.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=science&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront\\">NY Times</a></div>\\n",

The adult weighs from 33.6–65 g (1.19–2.29 oz), with an average 44.8 g (1.58 oz). The male averages slightly larger than the female. The adult male is a brilliant crimson red color with a black face mask over the eyes, extending to the upper chest. The color becomes duller and darker on the back and wings. The female is fawn, with mostly grayish-brown tones and a slight reddish tint on the wings, the crest, and the tail feathers. The face mask of the female is gray to black and is less defined than that of the male. Both sexes possess prominent raised crests and bright coral-colored beaks. The beak is cone-shaped and strong. Young birds, both male and female, show coloring similar to the adult female until the fall, when they molt and grow adult feathers. They are brown above and red-brown below, with brick-colored crest, forehead, wings, and tail. The legs and feet are a dark pink-brown. The iris of the eye is brown. The plumage color of the males is produced from carotenoid pigments in the diet. Coloration is produced from both red pigments and yellow carotenoid pigments. Northern cardinal males possess the ability to metabolize carotenoid pigments to create plumage pigmentation of a color different from the ingested pigment. When fed only yellow pigments, males become a pale red color, rather than a yellow. However, there are rare \\"yellow morph\\" cardinals, where all feathers (except for black face mask) and beak are a moderate yellow color. During the winter months, both male and female will fluff up their down feathers in order to trap warm air next to their body and keeping cold air from reaching their body. The down feathers are small and hairlike at the base of each flight feather. The legs and feet of almost all birds are thin and lack feathers, and so are vulnerable to rapid heat loss. Therefore, many take turns tucking one leg at a time into their body to keep them warm while still using the other to stand.</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tDistribution and habitat</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tNorthern cardinals are numerous across the eastern United States from Maine to Texas and in Canada in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Its range extends west to the U.S.–Mexico border and south through Mexico to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, northern Guatemala, and northern Belize. An allopatric population is found on the Pacific slope of Mexico from Jalisco to Oaxaca; note that this population is not shown on the range map. The species was introduced to Bermuda in 1700. It has also been introduced in Hawaii and southern California. Its natural habitat is woodlands, gardens, shrublands, and swamps.</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tEcology</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tSong</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tThe northern cardinal is a territorial song bird. The male sings in a loud, clear whistle from the top of a tree or another high location to defend his territory. He will chase off other males entering his territory. He may mistake his image on various reflective surfaces as an invading male, and will fight his reflection relentlessly. The northern cardinal learns its songs, and as a result the songs vary regionally. Mated pairs often travel together. Also, the songs of a northern cardinal will usually overlap more in syllables when compared to other northern cardinals near it than those far away from it.</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t<div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBoth sexes sing clear, whistled song patterns, which are repeated several times, then varied. Some common phrases are described as \\"cheeeer-a-dote, cheeer-a-dote-dote-dote\\", \\"purdy, purdy, purdy...whoit, whoit, whoit, whoit\\", \\"what-cheer, what-cheer... wheet, wheet, wheet, wheet\\" and \\"cheer, cheer, cheer, what, what, what, what\\". The northern cardinal has a distinctive alarm call, a short metallic chip sound. This call often is given when predators approach the nest, in order to give warning to the female and nestlings. In some cases it will also utter a series of chipping notes. The frequency and volume of these notes increases as the threat becomes greater. This chipping noise is also used by a cardinal pair to locate each other, especially during dusk hours when visibility wanes.</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe songs of the two sexes of the northern cardinal, although not distinguishable by the human ear, are sexually dimorphic.

Predators of chicks and eggs include milk snakes, coluber constrictors, blue jays, eastern gray squirrels, fox squirrels, eastern chipmunks and domestic cats.</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDiet</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe diet of the northern cardinal consists mainly (up to 90%) of weed seeds, grains, and fruits. It is a ground feeder and finds food while hopping on the ground through trees or shrubbery. It will also consume insects, including beetles, cicadas, grasshoppers, and snails; it feeds its young almost exclusively on insects. Other common items include corn (maize) and oats, sunflower seeds, the blossoms and bark of elm trees, and drinks maple sap from holes made by sapsuckers, an example of commensalism. During the summer months it shows preference for seeds that are easily husked, but is less selective when food is scarce during winter. Putting safflower seed in a feeder is a strong strategy for attracting them.</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tReproduction</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPairs mate for life, and stay together year-round. Mated pairs sometimes sing together before nesting. During courtship they may also participate in a bonding behavior where the male collects food and brings it to the female, feeding her beak-to-beak. If the mating is successful, this mate-feeding may continue throughout the period of incubation.</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMales sometimes bring nest material to the female, who does most of the building. She crushes twigs with her beak until they are pliable, then turns in the nest to bend the twigs around her body and push them into a cup shape with her feet. The cup has four layers: coarse twigs (and sometimes bits of trash) covered in a leafy mat, then lined with grapevine bark and finally grasses, stems, rootlets, and pine needles. The nest typically takes three to nine days to build; the finished product is 5.1–7.6 cm (2.0–3.0 in) tall, 10.1 cm (4.0 in) across, with an inner diameter of about 7.6 cm (3.0 in). Cardinals do not usually use their nests more than once. The female builds a cup nest in a well-concealed spot in dense shrub or a low tree 1–3 m (3.3–9.8 ft) off the ground. The nest is made of thin twigs, bark strips, and grasses, lined with grasses or other plant fibers. Eggs are laid one to six days following the completion of the nest. The eggs are white, with a tint of green, blue or brown, and are marked with lavender, gray, or brown blotches which are thicker around the larger end. The shell is smooth and slightly glossy. Three or four eggs are laid in each clutch. Eggs measure approximately 26 mm × 19 mm (1.02 in × 0.75 in) in size. The female generally incubates the eggs, though, rarely, the male will incubate for brief periods of time. Incubation takes 12 to 13 days. Young fledge 10 to 11 days after hatching. Two to three, and even four, broods are raised each year. The male cares for and feeds each brood as the female incubates the next clutch of eggs.</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe oldest wild cardinal banded by researchers lived at least 15 years and 9 months, although 28.5 years was achieved by a captive bird. Annual survival rates for adult northern cardinals have been estimated at 60 to 65%; however, as with other passerine birds, the high mortality of juveniles means that the average lifespan is only about a year.</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRelationship with humans</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe northern cardinal is found in residential areas throughout its range. Backyard birders attract it using feeders containing seeds, particularly sunflower seeds and safflower seeds. Although some controversy surrounds bird feeding, an increase in backyard feeding by humans has generally been beneficial to this species. It is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN Red List, with an estimated global range of 5,800,000 km2 (2,200,000 sq mi) and a global population of some 100 million. Populations appear to remain stable and not threatened to reach the threshold of inclusion as a threatened species, which requires a decline of more than 30% in ten years or three generations. It was once prized as a pet due to its bright color and distinctive song. In the United States, this species receives special legal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, which also banned their sale as cage birds. It is also protected by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds in Canada. It is illegal to take, kill, or possess northern cardinals, and violation of the law is punishable by a fine of up to US $15,000 and imprisonment of up to six months.</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the United States, the northern cardinal is the mascot of numerous athletic teams; however, most teams portray the bird with a yellow beak and legs.

In college athletics, it is the mascot of many schools including Ball State University, The Catholic University of America, Illinois State University, Iowa State University, Lamar University, the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, North Idaho College, Saint John Fisher College, the State University of New York at Plattsburgh, the University of Louisville, the University of the Incarnate Word, Wesleyan University, and Wheeling Jesuit University.</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tState bird</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe northern cardinal is the state bird of seven states, more than any other species: Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia, and West Virginia.

The adult weighs from 33.6–65 g (1.19–2.29 oz), with an average 44.8 g (1.58 oz). The male averages slightly larger than the female. The adult male is a brilliant crimson red color with a black face mask over the eyes, extending to the upper chest. The color becomes duller and darker on the back and wings. The female is fawn, with mostly grayish-brown tones and a slight reddish tint on the wings, the crest, and the tail feathers. The face mask of the female is gray to black and is less defined than that of the male. Both sexes possess prominent raised crests and bright coral-colored beaks. The beak is cone-shaped and strong. Young birds, both male and female, show coloring similar to the adult female until the fall, when they molt and grow adult feathers. They are brown above and red-brown below, with brick-colored crest, forehead, wings, and tail. The legs and feet are a dark pink-brown. The iris of the eye is brown. The plumage color of the males is produced from carotenoid pigments in the diet. Coloration is produced from both red pigments and yellow carotenoid pigments. Northern cardinal males possess the ability to metabolize carotenoid pigments to create plumage pigmentation of a color different from the ingested pigment. When fed only yellow pigments, males become a pale red color, rather than a yellow. However, there are rare \\"yellow morph\\" cardinals, where all feathers (except for black face mask) and beak are a moderate yellow color. During the winter months, both male and female will fluff up their down feathers in order to trap warm air next to their body and keeping cold air from reaching their body. The down feathers are small and hairlike at the base of each flight feather. The legs and feet of almost all birds are thin and lack feathers, and so are vulnerable to rapid heat loss. Therefore, many take turns tucking one leg at a time into their body to keep them warm while still using the other to stand.</div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t </div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tDistribution and habitat</div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tNorthern cardinals are numerous across the eastern United States from Maine to Texas and in Canada in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Its range extends west to the U.S.–Mexico border and south through Mexico to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, northern Guatemala, and northern Belize. An allopatric population is found on the Pacific slope of Mexico from Jalisco to Oaxaca; note that this population is not shown on the range map. The species was introduced to Bermuda in 1700. It has also been introduced in Hawaii and southern California. Its natural habitat is woodlands, gardens, shrublands, and swamps.</div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t </div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tEcology</div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tSong</div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tThe northern cardinal is a territorial song bird. The male sings in a loud, clear whistle from the top of a tree or another high location to defend his territory. He will chase off other males entering his territory. He may mistake his image on various reflective surfaces as an invading male, and will fight his reflection relentlessly. The northern cardinal learns its songs, and as a result the songs vary regionally. Mated pairs often travel together. Also, the songs of a northern cardinal will usually overlap more in syllables when compared to other northern cardinals near it than those far away from it.</div>\\n<div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBoth sexes sing clear, whistled song patterns, which are repeated several times, then varied. Some common phrases are described as \\"cheeeer-a-dote, cheeer-a-dote-dote-dote\\", \\"purdy, purdy, purdy...whoit, whoit, whoit, whoit\\", \\"what-cheer, what-cheer... wheet, wheet, wheet, wheet\\" and \\"cheer, cheer, cheer, what, what, what, what\\". The northern cardinal has a distinctive alarm call, a short metallic chip sound. This call often is given when predators approach the nest, in order to give warning to the female and nestlings. In some cases it will also utter a series of chipping notes. The frequency and volume of these notes increases as the threat becomes greater. This chipping noise is also used by a cardinal pair to locate each other, especially during dusk hours when visibility wanes.</div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t </div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe songs of the two sexes of the northern cardinal, although not distinguishable by the human ear, are sexually dimorphic. It is suggested that this is because of the differences in levels of hormones of the two sexes.</div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t </div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPredators</div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNorthern cardinals are preyed upon by a wide variety of predators native to North America, including falcons, all Accipiter hawks, shrikes, bald eagles, golden eagles and several owls, including long-eared owls, and eastern screech owls. Predators of chicks and eggs include milk snakes, coluber constrictors, blue jays, eastern gray squirrels, fox squirrels, eastern chipmunks and domestic cats.</div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t </div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDiet</div>\\n<div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe diet of the northern cardinal consists mainly (up to 90%) of weed seeds, grains, and fruits. It is a ground feeder and finds food while hopping on the ground through trees or shrubbery. It will also consume insects, including beetles, cicadas, grasshoppers, and snails; it feeds its young almost exclusively on insects. Other common items include corn (maize) and oats, sunflower seeds, the blossoms and bark of elm trees, and drinks maple sap from holes made by sapsuckers, an example of commensalism. During the summer months it shows preference for seeds that are easily husked, but is less selective when food is scarce during winter. Putting safflower seed in a feeder is a strong strategy for attracting them.</div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t </div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tReproduction</div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPairs mate for life, and stay together year-round. Mated pairs sometimes sing together before nesting. During courtship they may also participate in a bonding behavior where the male collects food and brings it to the female, feeding her beak-to-beak. If the mating is successful, this mate-feeding may continue throughout the period of incubation.</div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t </div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMales sometimes bring nest material to the female, who does most of the building. She crushes twigs with her beak until they are pliable, then turns in the nest to bend the twigs around her body and push them into a cup shape with her feet. The cup has four layers: coarse twigs (and sometimes bits of trash) covered in a leafy mat, then lined with grapevine bark and finally grasses, stems, rootlets, and pine needles. The nest typically takes three to nine days to build; the finished product is 5.1–7.6 cm (2.0–3.0 in) tall, 10.1 cm (4.0 in) across, with an inner diameter of about 7.6 cm (3.0 in). Cardinals do not usually use their nests more than once. The female builds a cup nest in a well-concealed spot in dense shrub or a low tree 1–3 m (3.3–9.8 ft) off the ground. The nest is made of thin twigs, bark strips, and grasses, lined with grasses or other plant fibers. Eggs are laid one to six days following the completion of the nest. The eggs are white, with a tint of green, blue or brown, and are marked with lavender, gray, or brown blotches which are thicker around the larger end. The shell is smooth and slightly glossy. Three or four eggs are laid in each clutch. Eggs measure approximately 26 mm × 19 mm (1.02 in × 0.75 in) in size. The female generally incubates the eggs, though, rarely, the male will incubate for brief periods of time. Incubation takes 12 to 13 days. Young fledge 10 to 11 days after hatching. Two to three, and even four, broods are raised each year. The male cares for and feeds each brood as the female incubates the next clutch of eggs.</div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t </div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe oldest wild cardinal banded by researchers lived at least 15 years and 9 months, although 28.5 years was achieved by a captive bird. Annual survival rates for adult northern cardinals have been estimated at 60 to 65%; however, as with other passerine birds, the high mortality of juveniles means that the average lifespan is only about a year.</div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t </div>\\n<div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRelationship with humans</div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe northern cardinal is found in residential areas throughout its range. Backyard birders attract it using feeders containing seeds, particularly sunflower seeds and safflower seeds. Although some controversy surrounds bird feeding, an increase in backyard feeding by humans has generally been beneficial to this species. It is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN Red List, with an estimated global range of 5,800,000 km2 (2,200,000 sq mi) and a global population of some 100 million. Populations appear to remain stable and not threatened to reach the threshold of inclusion as a threatened species, which requires a decline of more than 30% in ten years or three generations. It was once prized as a pet due to its bright color and distinctive song. In the United States, this species receives special legal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, which also banned their sale as cage birds. It is also protected by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds in Canada. It is illegal to take, kill, or possess northern cardinals, and violation of the law is punishable by a fine of up to US $15,000 and imprisonment of up to six months.</div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t </div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the United States, the northern cardinal is the mascot of numerous athletic teams; however, most teams portray the bird with a yellow beak and legs. In professional sports, it is the mascot of the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball\'s National League and the Arizona Cardinals of the National Football League. In college athletics, it is the mascot of many schools including Ball State University, The Catholic University of America, Illinois State University, Iowa State University, Lamar University, the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, North Idaho College, Saint John Fisher College, the State University of New York at Plattsburgh, the University of Louisville, the University of the Incarnate Word, Wesleyan University, and Wheeling Jesuit University.</div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t </div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tState bird</div>\\n<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe northern cardinal is the state bird of seven states, more than any other species: Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia, and West Virginia.

The binomial name derives from two Latin words: turdus, \\"thrush\\", and migratorius from migrare \\"to go\\". The term robin for this species has been recorded since at least 1703. There are about 65 species of medium to large thrushes in the genus Turdus, characterized by rounded heads, longish pointed wings, and usually melodious songs. A study of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene indicates that the American robin is not part of the Central/South American clade of Turdus thrushes; instead it shows genetic similarities to the Kurrichane thrush, T. libonyanus, and the olive thrush, T. olivaceus, both African species. This conflicts with a 2007 DNA study of 60 of 65 Turdus species which places the American robin\'s closest relative as the rufous-collared robin (T. rufitorques) of Central America. Though having distinct plumage, the two species are similar in vocalization and behavior. Beyond this, it lies in a small group of four species of otherwise Central American distribution, suggesting it recently spread northwards into North America.</p>\\r\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\r\\n\\t<p>Seven subspecies of American robin are recognized. These subspecies intergrade and are only weakly defined.</p>\\r\\n\\t<ol>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tT. m. migratorius, the nominate subspecies, breeds in the US and Canada, other than down the west coast, to the edge of the tundra from Alaska and northern Canada east to New England and then south to Maryland, northwest Virginia, and North Carolina. It winters in southern coastal Alaska, southern Canada, most of the US, Bermuda, the Bahamas and eastern Mexico.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tT. m. nigrideus breeds from coastal northern Quebec to Labrador and Newfoundland and winters from southern Newfoundland south through most of the eastern US states to southern Louisiana, southern Mississippi and northern Georgia. It is uniformly darker or blackish on the head, with a dark gray back. The underparts are slightly more red than those of the nominate subspecies.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tT. m. achrusterus breeds from southern Oklahoma east to Maryland and western Virginia and south to northern Florida and the Gulf states. It winters through much of the southern part of the breeding range. It is smaller than the nominate subspecies. The black feathers of the forehead and crown have pale gray tips. The underparts are paler than those of the nominate subspecies.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tT. m. caurinus breeds in southeast Alaska through coastal British Columbia to Washington and northwest Oregon. It winters from southwest British Columbia south to central and southern California and east to northern Idaho. It is very slightly smaller than the nominate subspecies and very dark-headed. The white on the tips of the outer two tail feathers is restricted.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tT. m. propinquus breeds from southeast British Columbia, southern Alberta, southwest Saskatchewan south to southern California and northern Baja California. It winters throughout much of the southern breeding range and south to Baja California. It is the same size as or slightly larger than nominate T. m. migratorius, but paler and tinged more heavily brownish-gray. It has very little white on the tip of the outermost tail feather. Some birds, probably females, lack almost any red below. Males are usually darker and may show pale or whitish sides to the head.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tT. m. confinis breeds above 1,000 m (3,300 ft) in the highlands of southern Baja California. This form is particularly distinctive, with pale gray-brown underparts. It is relatively small, and the palest subspecies, with uniform pale gray-brown on the head, face and upperparts. It usually lacks any white spots to the tips of the outer tail feathers, which have white edges. It is sometimes classed as a separate species, the San Lucas robin, but the American Ornithologists\' Union regards it as only a subspecies, albeit in a different group from the other races.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tT. m. phillipsi is resident in Mexico south to central Oaxaca. It is slightly smaller than propinquus but has a larger bill; the male\'s underparts are less brick-red than the nominate subspecies, and have a rustier tone.</li>\\r\\n\\t</ol>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Description</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe nominate subspecies of the American robin is 23 to 28 cm (9.1 to 11.0 in) long with a wingspan ranging from 31 to 41 cm (12 to 16 in), with similar size ranges across all races. The species averages about 77 g (2.7 oz) in weight, with males ranging from 72 to 94 g (2.5 to 3.3 oz) and females ranging from 59 to 91 g (2.1 to 3.2 oz). Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 11.5 to 14.5 cm (4.5 to 5.7 in), the culmen is 1.8 to 2.2 cm (0.71 to 0.87 in) and the tarsus is 2.9 to 3.3 cm (1.1 to 1.3 in). The head varies from jet black to gray, with white eye arcs and white supercilia. The throat is white with black streaks, and the belly and undertail coverts are white. The robin has a brown back and a reddish-orange breast, varying from a rich red maroon to peachy orange. The bill is mainly yellow with a variably dark tip, the dusky area becoming more extensive in winter, and the legs and feet are brown.The sexes are similar, but the female tends to be duller than the male, with a brown tint to the head, brown upperparts and less bright underparts. However, some birds cannot be safely sexed on plumage alone. The juvenile is paler in color than the adult male and has dark spots on its breast, and whitish wing coverts. First-year birds are not easily distinguishable from adults, but they tend to be duller, and a small percentage retains a few juvenile wing coverts or other feathers.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThis bird breeds throughout most of North America, from Alaska and Canada southward to northern Florida and Mexico. While robins occasionally overwinter in the northern part of the United States and southern Canada, most migrate to winter south of Canada from Florida and the Gulf Coast to central Mexico, as well as along the Pacific Coast. Most depart south by the end of August and begin to return north in February and March (exact dates vary with latitude and climate). Despite being depicted in the film Mary Poppins \\"feathering its nest\\" in London, this species is actually a rare vagrant to western Europe, where the majority of records, more than 20, have been in Britain. In autumn 2003, migration was displaced eastwards leading to massive movements through the eastern U.S., and presumably this is what led to no fewer than three American robins being found in Britain, with two attempting to overwinter in 2003–2004, although one was taken by a sparrowhawk. A sighting occurred in Britain in January 2007.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">This species has also occurred as a vagrant to Greenland, Jamaica, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico and Belize. Vagrants to Europe, where identified to subspecies, are nominate T. m. migratorius, but the Greenland birds also included T. m. nigrideus, and some of the southern overshots may have been T. m. achrusterus.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The American robin\'s breeding habitat is woodland and more open farmland and urban areas. It becomes less common as a breeder in the southernmost part of the Deep South of the United States, and there prefers large shade trees on lawns. Its winter habitat is similar but includes more open areas.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Conservation status</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe American robin has an extensive range, estimated at 16,000,000 km2 (6,200,000 sq mi), and a large population of about 320 million individuals. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as least concern. At one point, the bird was killed for its meat, but it is now protected throughout its range in the United States by the Migratory Bird Act.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Birds in central California of the subspecies propinquus are considered to be still increasing their range, and this is probably the case elsewhere in the U.S.A.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Disease</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe American robin is a known reservoir (carrier) for West Nile virus. While crows and jays are often the first noticed deaths in an area with West Nile virus, the American robin is suspected to be a key host, and holds a larger responsibility for the transmission of the virus to humans. This is because, while crows and jays die quickly from the virus, the American robin survives the virus longer, hence spreading it to more mosquitoes, which then transmit the virus to humans and other species.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Behavior</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe American robin is active mostly during the day, and on its winter grounds it assembles in large flocks at night to roost in trees in secluded swamps or dense vegetation. The flocks break up during the day when the birds feed on fruits and berries in smaller groups. During the summer, the American robin defends a breeding territory and is less social.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Diet</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe American robin\'s diet generally consists of around 40 percent small invertebrates (mainly insects), such as earthworms, beetle grubs, caterpillars and grasshoppers, and 60 percent wild and cultivated fruits and berries. Their ability to switch to berries allows them to winter much farther north than most other North American thrushes. They will flock to fermented Pyracantha berries, and after eating sufficient quantities will exhibit intoxicated behavior such as falling over while walking. Robins forage primarily on the ground for soft-bodied invertebrates, and find worms by sight (and sometimes by hearing), pouncing on them and then pulling them up. Nestlings are fed mainly on worms and other soft-bodied animal prey. In some areas, robins, particularly of the coastal race T. m. caurinus, will feed on beaches, taking insects and small mollusks.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The robin uses auditory, visual, olfactory and possibly vibrotactile cues to ﬁnd prey, but vision is the predominant mode of prey detection. It is frequently seen running across lawns picking up earthworms, and its running and stopping behavior is a distinguishing characteristic. In addition to hunting visually, it also has the ability to hunt by hearing. Experiments have discovered that it can find worms underground by simply using its listening skills. It typically will take several short hops and then cock its head left, right or forward to detect movement of its prey. In urban areas, robins will gather in numbers soon after lawns are mowed or where sprinklers are in use. They also are attracted to freshly turned earth in gardens, where worms and grubs are abundant targets. Occasionally, they may visit bird feeders if mealworms or animal-fat suet is offered.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Threats</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tJuvenile robins and eggs are preyed upon by squirrels, snakes, and some birds, such as blue jays, Steller\'s jay, common grackles, American crows, and common ravens. Adults are primarily taken by Accipiter hawks, cats, dogs, and larger snakes (especially rat snakes). They may be taken by nearly every variety of North American accipitrid, from the smallest, the sharp-shinned hawk, to one of the two largest, the golden eagle, most every North American falcon from the smallest, the American kestrel, to the largest, the gyrfalcon, and almost all owl species from northern pygmy owls to snowy owls. Overall, 28 raptorial bird species are known to hunt robins. Adult robins are most vulnerable when distracted by breeding activities though may also be attacked on the ground or even in flight. However, when feeding in flocks, the American robin is able to remain vigilant and watch other flock members for reactions to predators.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The American robin is known to be a rejecter of cowbird eggs, so brood parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird is rare. Even when it occurs, the parasite\'s chick does not normally survive to fledging. In a study of 105 juvenile robins, 77.1% were infected with one or more species of endoparasite, with Syngamus species the most commonly encountered, found in 57.1% of the birds.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Breeding</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe American robin begins to breed shortly after returning to its summer range. It is one of the first North American bird species to lay eggs, and normally has two to three broods per breeding season, which lasts from April to July.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The nest is most commonly located 1.5–4.5 m (4.9–14.8 ft) above the ground in a dense bush or in a fork between two tree branches, and is built by the female alone. The outer foundation consists of long coarse grass, twigs, paper, and feathers. This is lined with smeared mud and cushioned with fine grass or other soft materials. A new nest is built for each brood, and in northern areas the first clutch is usually placed in an evergreen tree or shrub while later broods are placed in deciduous trees. The American robin does not shy away from nesting close to human habitation and will frequently construct nests under eaves or awnings on human homes when such locations provide adequate shelter. Robins are not cavity nesters, and so will generally not use a bird house, but will take advantage of artificial nesting platforms.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">A clutch consists of three to five light-blue eggs, and is incubated by the female alone. The eggs hatch after 14 days, and the chicks leave the nest a further two weeks later. The altricial chicks are naked and have their eyes closed for the first few days after hatching. While the chicks are still young, the mother broods them continuously. When they are older, the mother will brood them only at night or during bad weather.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The chicks are fed worms, insects, and berries. Waste accumulation does not occur in the nest because adults collect and take it away. Chicks are fed, and then raise tails for elimination of waste, a solid white clump that is collected by a parent prior to flying off. All chicks in the brood leave the nest within two days of each other. Even after leaving the nest, the juveniles will follow their parents around and beg food from them. Juveniles become capable of sustained flight two weeks after fledging.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The adult male and female both are active in protecting and feeding the fledged chicks until they learn to forage on their own. The adult robin gives alarm calls and dives in a threatening manner towards creatures it considers potential predators, such as approaching cats, dogs and humans. The fledglings are able to fly short distances after leaving the nest. The wings of juvenile birds develop rapidly, and it only takes a couple of weeks for them to become proficient at flying. The cryptically colored young birds perch in bushes or trees for protection from predators.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Bird banders have found that only 25% of young robins survive the first year. The longest known lifespan in the wild of an American robin is 14 years; the average lifespan is about 2 years.</p>\\r\\n\\t<div class=\\"stamp\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">U.S. Postage stamp from 1982 (Scott #1959) features a watercolor picturing an American robin and a Mountain laurel, Connecticut’s state bird and flower.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The story of these stamps begins in 1978, when Fleetwood hired father-son wildlife artists Arthur and Alan Singer to create 50 original paintings of state birds and flowers for a set of Fleetwood.

The cryptically colored young birds perch in bushes or trees for protection from predators.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Bird banders have found that only 25% of young robins survive the first year.

They are mainly found in tropical South America, with one species in Central America. Two species, Phoneutria fera and Phoneutria nigriventer, are known as the Brazilian wandering spider; the genus as a whole is sometimes called Brazilian wandering spiders, although not all species occur in Brazil. Other English names include armed spiders (armadeiras in Brazilian Portuguese) and banana spiders (a name shared with several others).</p>\\r\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The spiders in the genus can grow to have a leg span of 13 to 15 cm (5.1 to 5.9 in). Their body length ranges from 17 to 48 mm (0.67 to 1.89 in). While some other araneomorph spiders have a longer leg span, the largest Phoneutria species have the longest body and the greatest body weight in this group. The genus is distinguished from other related genera such as Ctenus by the presence of dense prolateral scopulae (a dense brush of fine hairs) on the pedipalp tibiae and tarsi in both sexes. Phoneutria are easily confused with several other non-medically significant ctenids, especially Cupiennius, in which the recently described C. chiapanensis also has bright red hairs on the chelicerae. Additionally, some Phoneutria species lack red hairs on the chelicerae, making it an unreliable identification feature. The presence of a dark linear stripe or stripes on the frontal (dorsal) palps and presence of a single thin black line running anterior-posterior along the dorsal carapace may help identify Phoneutria. Other features are the strong ventral marking on the underside of the legs with contrasting dark mid-segments and lighter joints, and the pattern on the ventral (underside) of the abdomen with several rows of black dots, or an overall reddish colour.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The characteristic defensive posture with frontal legs held high is an especially good indicator to confirm a specimen is Phoneutria, especially alongside correct colour patterns. During the defensive display the body is lifted up into an erect position, the first two pairs of legs are lifted high (revealing the conspicuous black/light-banded pattern on the leg underside), while the spider sways from side to side with hind legs in a cocked position.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Taxonomy<br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe genus Phoneutria was erected by Maximilian Perty in 1833. The genus name is from the Greek φονεύτρια, meaning \\"murderess\\". Perty placed two species in the genus: Phoneutria rufibarbis and Phoneutria fera.[The former is treated as a \\"doubtful name\\" (nomen dubium); the latter as the type species of the genus.</p>\\r\\n\\t<div class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>Behavior<br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tWandering spiders are so-called because they wander the jungle floor at night, rather than residing in a lair or maintaining a web. During the day they hide inside termite mounds, under fallen logs and rocks, and in banana plants (hence the \\"banana spider\\" nickname) and bromeliads. P. nigriventer is known to hide in dark and moist places in or near human dwellings.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>P. nigriventer mates during the dry season from April to June, which leads to frequent observations of the species during this time.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>Distribution<br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPhoneutria are found in forests from Costa Rica, and throughout South America east of the Andes into northern Argentina, including Colombia, Venezuela, the Guianas, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil and Paraguay. Three species (P. reidyi, P. boliviensis and P. fera) are found in the Amazon region, one species (P. fera) is restricted to the Amazon, and one (P. boliviensis) ranges into Central America in Panama and Costa Rica. The remaining species are restricted to Atlantic Forest of Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil, including forest fragments in the Cerrado savanna. In Brazil, Phoneutria is only absent in the northeastern region north of Salvador, Bahia.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>Toxicity and prey<br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tThe venom of Phoneutria nigriventer contains a potent neurotoxin, known as PhTx3, which acts as a broad-spectrum calcium channel blocker that inhibits glutamate release, calcium uptake and also glutamate uptake in neural synapses. At deadly concentrations, this neurotoxin causes loss of muscle control and breathing problems, resulting in paralysis and eventual asphyxiation. In addition, the venom causes intense pain and inflammation following a bite due to an excitatory effect the venom has on the serotonin 5-HT4 receptors of sensory nerves. This sensory nerve stimulation causes a release of neuropeptides such as substance P which triggers inflammation and pain. The median lethal dose (LD50) of the venom is 134 µg/kg. Differences between the venom of male and female Phoneutria nigriventer have been reported, with females producing a higher quantity of venom.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>Aside from causing intense pain, the venom of the spider can also cause priapism in humans. Erections resulting from the bite are uncomfortable, can last for many hours and can lead to impotence. A component of the venom (Tx2-6) is being studied for use in erectile dysfunction treatments.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>The amount of P. nigriventer venom necessary to kill a 20 g mouse has been shown to be only 6 μg intravenously and 134 μg subcutaneously as compared to 110 μg and 200 μg respectively for Latrodectus mactans (Southern black widow). This ranks Phoneutria venom among the most deadly spider venoms to mice. The Brazilian wandering spider\'s prey also includes crickets, katydids, mantids, and other larger animals, including tree frogs and lizards.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>Danger to humans<br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tThe genus Phoneutria includes some of the relatively few species of spiders known to present a threat to humans. Danger to humans is not merely a question of toxicity, but requires the capacity to deliver the venom, a sufficient quantity of venom, a disposition that makes a bite likely and proximity to human habitation. The actual incidence of death or serious injury must also be considered.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>Spider mouthparts are adapted to envenom very small prey; they are not well-adapted to attacking large mammals such as humans. Some experts believe that various spiders like Phoneutria can deliver a \\"dry\\" bite to purposely conserve their venom, as opposed to a more primitive spider like Atrax that usually delivers a full load.[citation needed] A study in March 2009 suggests that Phoneutria inject venom in approximately one-third of their bites, and only a small quantity in one-third of those cases. Another study similarly suggested that only 2.3 percent of bites (mainly in children) were serious enough to require antivenom. Other studies, as cited in the Wolfgang Bücherl studies, showed that the toxicity of Phoneutria venom was clearly more potent than both Latrodectus and Atrax. Research in this area is hindered by the difficulty of identifying particular species. Nevertheless, there are well-attested instances of death. In one case, a single spider killed two children in São Sebastião. The spider was positively identified as a Phoneutria by Wolfgang Bücherl.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>Despite their reputation, there are multiple studies that call into question their capacity for fatal human envenomation, though some of these are labeled with a level of uncertainty, as Phoneutria are often confused with other genera of ctenids, lycosids or other large labidognatha spiders. Of the eight described species, P. nigriventer and P. fera most frequently receive mention in mass-media publications. P. nigriventer is the species responsible for most cases of venom intoxication in Brazil because it is commonly found in highly populated areas of southeastern Brazil, such as the states of São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo. The species P. fera is native to the northern portion of South America in the Amazon of Brazil, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru and the Guyanas.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>These spiders\' wandering nature is another reason they are considered so dangerous. In densely populated areas, Phoneutria species usually search for cover and dark places to hide during daytime, leading it to hide in houses, clothes, cars, boots, boxes and log piles, where they may bite if accidentally disturbed.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>Banana shipments<br />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tThese spiders acquired their other common name, \\"banana spider\\", because it is claimed that they are occasionally found in shipments of bananas, though the number of reports is exaggerated due to common misidentifications of unrelated spiders. A survey of spiders found in international shipments to North America revealed that only 7 of 135 spiders were Phoneutria species, six being Phoneutria boliviensis from bananas and one Phoneutria nigriventer from a shipment of electrical parts. Spiders such as Cupiennius species had been misidentified by otherwise experienced arachnologists. Cases continue to be reported but without evidence of expert identification. In 2005 a man was bitten in Bridgwater, England by a spider in a shipment of bananas claimed to be P. fera; he was quickly treated but took a week to recover. In 2014 a family in London found and photographed a spider claimed to be P. fera in a bunch of bananas delivered to their home.</p>\\r\\n\\t</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n",

The spider was positively identified as a Phoneutria by Wolfgang Bücherl.</p>\\n<p>Despite their reputation, there are multiple studies that call into question their capacity for fatal human envenomation, though some of these are labeled with a level of uncertainty, as Phoneutria are often confused with other genera of ctenids, lycosids or other large labidognatha spiders. Of the eight described species, P. nigriventer and P. fera most frequently receive mention in mass-media publications. P. nigriventer is the species responsible for most cases of venom intoxication in Brazil because it is commonly found in highly populated areas of southeastern Brazil, such as the states of São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo. The species P. fera is native to the northern portion of South America in the Amazon of Brazil, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru and the Guyanas.</p>\\n<p>These spiders\' wandering nature is another reason they are considered so dangerous. In densely populated areas, Phoneutria species usually search for cover and dark places to hide during daytime, leading it to hide in houses, clothes, cars, boots, boxes and log piles, where they may bite if accidentally disturbed.</p>\\n<p>Banana shipments<br />\\n\\t\\t\\tThese spiders acquired their other common name, \\"banana spider\\", because it is claimed that they are occasionally found in shipments of bananas, though the number of reports is exaggerated due to common misidentifications of unrelated spiders. A survey of spiders found in international shipments to North America revealed that only 7 of 135 spiders were Phoneutria species, six being Phoneutria boliviensis from bananas and one Phoneutria nigriventer from a shipment of electrical parts. Spiders such as Cupiennius species had been misidentified by otherwise experienced arachnologists. Cases continue to be reported but without evidence of expert identification. In 2005 a man was bitten in Bridgwater, England by a spider in a shipment of bananas claimed to be P. fera; he was quickly treated but took a week to recover. In 2014 a family in London found and photographed a spider claimed to be P. fera in a bunch of bananas delivered to their home.</p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n",

            \'value\' => "<p>The muskrat\'s name probably comes from a word of Algonquian (possibly Powhatan) origin, muscascus (literally \\"it is red\\", so called for its colorings), or from the Abenaki native word mòskwas, as seen in the archaic English name for the animal, musquash. Because of the association with the \\"musky\\" odor, which the muskrat uses to mark its territory, and its flattened tail, the name became altered to musk-beaver; later it became muskrat due to its resemblance to rats. Similarly, its specific name zibethicus means \\"musky\\", being the adjective of zibethus \\"civet musk; civet\\". The genus name comes from the Huron word for the animal, ondathra, and entered New Latin as Ondatra via French.</p>\\r\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Description</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tAn adult muskrat is about 40–70 cm (16–28 in) long, half of that is the tail, and weighs from 0.6–2 kg (1.3–4.4 lb). That is about four times the weight of the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), though an adult muskrat is only slightly longer, and are almost certainly the largest and heaviest members of the diverse family Cricetidae, which includes all voles, lemmings, and most mice native to the Americas. Muskrats are much smaller than beavers (Castor canadensis), with which they often share their habitat. Muskrats are covered with short, thick fur, which is medium to dark brown or black in color, with the belly a bit lighter (countershaded); as the age increases, it turns a partly gray in color. The fur has two layers, which helps protect them from the cold water. They have long tails covered with scales rather than hair, and to aid them in swimming, are slightly flattened vertically, which is a shape that is unique to them. When they walk on land, their tails drag on the ground, which makes their tracks easy to recognize. Muskrats spend most of their time in the water and are well suited for their semiaquatic life. They can swim under water for 12 to 17 minutes. Their bodies, like those of seals and whales, are less sensitive to the buildup of carbon dioxide than those of most other mammals. They can close off their ears to keep the water out. Their hind feet are semi-webbed, although in swimming, their tails are their main means of propulsion.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Distribution and ecology</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tMuskrats are found over most of Canada and the United States and a small part of northern Mexico. They were introduced to Europe in the beginning of the 20th century and have become an invasive species in northwestern Europe. They mostly inhabit wetlands, areas in or near saline and freshwater wetlands, rivers, lakes, or ponds. They are not found in Florida, where the round-tailed muskrat, or Florida water rat (Neofiber alleni), fills their ecological niche. Their populations naturally cycle; in areas where they become abundant, they are capable of removing much of the vegetation in wetlands. They are thought to play a major role in determining the vegetation of prairie wetlands in particular. They also selectively remove preferred plant species, thereby changing the abundance of plant species in many kinds of wetlands. Species commonly eaten include cattail and yellow water lily. Alligators are thought to be an important natural predator, and the absence of muskrats from Florida may in part be the result of alligator predation. While much wetland habitat has been eliminated due to human activity, new muskrat habitat has been created by the construction of canals or irrigation channels, and the muskrat remains common and widespread. They are able to live alongside streams which contain the sulfurous water that drains away from coal mines. Fish and frogs perish in such streams, yet muskrats may thrive and occupy the wetlands. Muskrats also benefit from human persecution of some of their predators The muskrat is classed as a \\"prohibited new organism\\" under New Zealand\'s Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996, preventing it from being imported into the country. Trematode Metorchis conjunctus can also infect muskrats.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Behavior</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tMuskrats normally live in groups consisting of a male and female pair and their young. During the spring, they often fight with other muskrats over territory and potential mates. Many are injured or killed in these fights. Muskrat families build nests to protect themselves and their young from cold and predators. In streams, ponds, or lakes, muskrats burrow into the bank with an underwater entrance. These entrances are 6–8 in (15–20 cm) wide. In marshes, push-ups are constructed from vegetation and mud. These push-ups are up to 3 ft (91 cm) in height. In snowy areas, they keep the openings to their push-ups closed by plugging them with vegetation, which they replace every day. Some muskrat push-ups are swept away in spring floods and have to be replaced each year. Muskrats also build feeding platforms in wetlands. They help maintain open areas in marshes, which helps to provide habitat for aquatic birds. Muskrats are most active at night or near dawn and dusk. They feed on cattail and other aquatic vegetation. They do not store food for the winter, but sometimes eat the insides of their push-ups. While they may appear to steal food beavers have stored, more seemingly cooperative partnerships with beavers exist, as featured in the BBC David Attenborough wildlife documentary The Life of Mammals. Plant materials compose about 95% of their diets, but they also eat small animals, such as freshwater mussels, frogs, crayfish, fish, and small turtles. Muskrats follow trails they make in swamps and ponds. When the water freezes, they continue to follow their trails under the ice. Muskrats provide an important food resource for many other animals, including mink, foxes, coyotes, wolves, lynx, bears, eagles, snakes, alligators, and large owls and hawks. Otters, snapping turtles, and large fish such as pike prey on baby muskrats. Caribou and elk sometimes feed on the vegetation which makes up muskrat push-ups during the winter when other food is scarce for them. In their introduced range in the former Soviet Union, the muskrat\'s greatest predator is the golden jackal. They can be completely eradicated in shallow water bodies, and during the winter of 1948–49 in the Amu Darya (river in central Asia), muskrats constituted 12.3% of jackal faeces contents, and 71% of muskrat houses were destroyed by jackals, 16% of which froze and became unsuitable for muskrat occupation. Jackals also harm the muskrat industry by eating muskrats caught in traps or taking skins left out to dry. Muskrats, like most rodents, are prolific breeders. Females can have two or three litters a year of six to eight young each. The babies are born small and hairless, and weigh only about 22 g (0.78 oz).

            \'safe_value\' => "<p>The muskrat\'s name probably comes from a word of Algonquian (possibly Powhatan) origin, muscascus (literally \\"it is red\\", so called for its colorings), or from the Abenaki native word mòskwas, as seen in the archaic English name for the animal, musquash. Because of the association with the \\"musky\\" odor, which the muskrat uses to mark its territory, and its flattened tail, the name became altered to musk-beaver; later it became muskrat due to its resemblance to rats. Similarly, its specific name zibethicus means \\"musky\\", being the adjective of zibethus \\"civet musk; civet\\". The genus name comes from the Huron word for the animal, ondathra, and entered New Latin as Ondatra via French.</p>\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\n<p><u>Description</u><br />\\n\\t\\tAn adult muskrat is about 40–70 cm (16–28 in) long, half of that is the tail, and weighs from 0.6–2 kg (1.3–4.4 lb). That is about four times the weight of the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), though an adult muskrat is only slightly longer, and are almost certainly the largest and heaviest members of the diverse family Cricetidae, which includes all voles, lemmings, and most mice native to the Americas. Muskrats are much smaller than beavers (Castor canadensis), with which they often share their habitat. Muskrats are covered with short, thick fur, which is medium to dark brown or black in color, with the belly a bit lighter (countershaded); as the age increases, it turns a partly gray in color. The fur has two layers, which helps protect them from the cold water. They have long tails covered with scales rather than hair, and to aid them in swimming, are slightly flattened vertically, which is a shape that is unique to them. When they walk on land, their tails drag on the ground, which makes their tracks easy to recognize. Muskrats spend most of their time in the water and are well suited for their semiaquatic life. They can swim under water for 12 to 17 minutes. Their bodies, like those of seals and whales, are less sensitive to the buildup of carbon dioxide than those of most other mammals. They can close off their ears to keep the water out. Their hind feet are semi-webbed, although in swimming, their tails are their main means of propulsion.</p>\\n<p><u>Distribution and ecology</u><br />\\n\\t\\tMuskrats are found over most of Canada and the United States and a small part of northern Mexico. They were introduced to Europe in the beginning of the 20th century and have become an invasive species in northwestern Europe. They mostly inhabit wetlands, areas in or near saline and freshwater wetlands, rivers, lakes, or ponds. They are not found in Florida, where the round-tailed muskrat, or Florida water rat (Neofiber alleni), fills their ecological niche. Their populations naturally cycle; in areas where they become abundant, they are capable of removing much of the vegetation in wetlands. They are thought to play a major role in determining the vegetation of prairie wetlands in particular. They also selectively remove preferred plant species, thereby changing the abundance of plant species in many kinds of wetlands. Species commonly eaten include cattail and yellow water lily. Alligators are thought to be an important natural predator, and the absence of muskrats from Florida may in part be the result of alligator predation. While much wetland habitat has been eliminated due to human activity, new muskrat habitat has been created by the construction of canals or irrigation channels, and the muskrat remains common and widespread. They are able to live alongside streams which contain the sulfurous water that drains away from coal mines. Fish and frogs perish in such streams, yet muskrats may thrive and occupy the wetlands. Muskrats also benefit from human persecution of some of their predators The muskrat is classed as a \\"prohibited new organism\\" under New Zealand\'s Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996, preventing it from being imported into the country. Trematode Metorchis conjunctus can also infect muskrats.</p>\\n<p><u>Behavior</u><br />\\n\\t\\tMuskrats normally live in groups consisting of a male and female pair and their young. During the spring, they often fight with other muskrats over territory and potential mates. Many are injured or killed in these fights. Muskrat families build nests to protect themselves and their young from cold and predators. In streams, ponds, or lakes, muskrats burrow into the bank with an underwater entrance. These entrances are 6–8 in (15–20 cm) wide. In marshes, push-ups are constructed from vegetation and mud. These push-ups are up to 3 ft (91 cm) in height. In snowy areas, they keep the openings to their push-ups closed by plugging them with vegetation, which they replace every day. Some muskrat push-ups are swept away in spring floods and have to be replaced each year. Muskrats also build feeding platforms in wetlands. They help maintain open areas in marshes, which helps to provide habitat for aquatic birds. Muskrats are most active at night or near dawn and dusk. They feed on cattail and other aquatic vegetation. They do not store food for the winter, but sometimes eat the insides of their push-ups. While they may appear to steal food beavers have stored, more seemingly cooperative partnerships with beavers exist, as featured in the BBC David Attenborough wildlife documentary The Life of Mammals. Plant materials compose about 95% of their diets, but they also eat small animals, such as freshwater mussels, frogs, crayfish, fish, and small turtles. Muskrats follow trails they make in swamps and ponds. When the water freezes, they continue to follow their trails under the ice. Muskrats provide an important food resource for many other animals, including mink, foxes, coyotes, wolves, lynx, bears, eagles, snakes, alligators, and large owls and hawks. Otters, snapping turtles, and large fish such as pike prey on baby muskrats. Caribou and elk sometimes feed on the vegetation which makes up muskrat push-ups during the winter when other food is scarce for them. In their introduced range in the former Soviet Union, the muskrat\'s greatest predator is the golden jackal. They can be completely eradicated in shallow water bodies, and during the winter of 1948–49 in the Amu Darya (river in central Asia), muskrats constituted 12.3% of jackal faeces contents, and 71% of muskrat houses were destroyed by jackals, 16% of which froze and became unsuitable for muskrat occupation. Jackals also harm the muskrat industry by eating muskrats caught in traps or taking skins left out to dry. Muskrats, like most rodents, are prolific breeders. Females can have two or three litters a year of six to eight young each. The babies are born small and hairless, and weigh only about 22 g (0.78 oz). In southern environments, young muskrats mature in six months, while in colder northern environments, it takes about a year. Muskrat populations appear to go through a regular pattern of rise and dramatic decline spread over a six- to 10-year period. Some other rodents, including famously the muskrat\'s close relatives the lemmings, go through the same type of population changes.</p>\\n<p><u>In human history</u><br />\\n\\t\\tNative Americans have long considered the muskrat to be a very important animal.

            \'value\' => "<p>As true wild boars became extinct in Britain before the development of modern English, the same terms are often used for both true wild boar and pigs, especially large or semi-wild ones. The English \'boar\' stems from the Old English bar, which is thought to be derived from the West Germanic *bairaz, of unknown origin. Boar is sometimes used specifically to refer to males, and may also be used to refer to male domesticated pigs, especially breeding males that have not been castrated. \'Sow\', the traditional name for a female, again comes from Old English and Germanic; it stems from Proto-Indo-European, and is related to the Latin sus and Greek hus and more closely to the modern German Sau. The young may be called \'piglets\'. The animals\' specific name scrofa is Latin for \'sow\'.</p>\\r\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\r\\n\\t<p>Taxonomy and evolution<br />\\r\\n\\t\\tMtDNA studies indicate that the wild boar originated from islands in Southeast Asia such as Indonesia and the Philippines, and subsequently spread onto mainland Eurasia and North Africa. The earliest fossil finds of the species come from both Europe and Asia, and date back to the Early Pleistocene. By the late Villafranchian, S. scrofa largely displaced the related S. strozzii, a large, possibly swamp-adapted suid ancestral to the modern S. verrucosus throughout the Eurasian mainland, restricting it to insular Asia. Its closest wild relative is the bearded pig of Malacca and surrounding islands.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>Domestication<br />\\r\\n\\t\\tWith the exception of domestic pigs in Timor and Papua New Guinea (which appear to be of Sulawesi warty pig stock), the wild boar is the ancestor of most pig breeds. Archaeological evidence suggests that pigs were domesticated from wild boar as early as 13,000–12,700 BC in the Near East in the Tigris Basin being managed in the wild in a way similar to the way they are managed by some modern New Guineans. Remains of pigs have been dated to earlier than 11,400 BC in Cyprus. Those animals must have been introduced from the mainland, which suggests domestication in the adjacent mainland by then. There was also a separate domestication in China which took place about 8000 years ago. DNA evidence from sub-fossil remains of teeth and jawbones of Neolithic pigs shows that the first domestic pigs in Europe had been brought from the Near East. This stimulated the domestication of local European wild boar resulting in a third domestication event with the Near Eastern genes dying out in European pig stock. Modern domesticated pigs have involved complex exchanges, with European domesticated lines being exported in turn to the ancient Near East. Historical records indicate that Asian pigs were introduced into Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries. Domestic pigs tend to have much more developed hindquarters than their wild boar ancestors, to the point where 70% of their body weight is concentrated in the posterior, which is the opposite of wild boar, where most of the muscles are concentrated on the head and shoulders.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>Physical description<br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe wild boar is a bulky, massively built suid with short and relatively thin legs. The trunk is short and massive, while the hindquarters are comparatively underdeveloped. The region behind the shoulder blades rises into a hump, and the neck is short and thick, to the point of being nearly immobile. The animal\'s head is very large, taking up to one third of the body\'s entire length. The structure of the head is well suited for digging. The head acts as a plough, while the powerful neck muscles allow the animal to upturn considerable amounts of soil: it is capable of digging 8–10 cm (3.1–3.9 in) into frozen ground and can upturn rocks weighing 40–50 kg (88–110 lb). The eyes are small and deep-set, and the ears long and broad. The species has well developed canine teeth, which protrude from the mouths of adult males. The middle hooves are larger and more elongated than the lateral ones, and are capable of quick movements. The animal can run at a maximum speed of 40 km/h and jump at a height of 140–150 cm (55–59 in). Sexual dimorphism is very pronounced in the species, with males being typically 5–10% larger and 20–30% heavier than females. Males also sport a mane running down the back, which is particularly apparent during autumn and winter. The canine teeth are also much more prominent in males, and grow throughout life. The upper canines are relatively short and grow sideways early in life, though gradually curve upwards. The lower canines are much sharper and longer, with the exposed parts measuring 10–12 cm (3.9–4.7 in) in length. In the breeding period, males develop a coating of subcutaneous tissue, which may be 2–3 cm (0.79–1.18 in) thick, extending from the shoulder blades to the rump, thus protecting vital organs during fights. Males sport a roughly egg-sized sack near the opening of the penis, which collects urine and emits a sharp odour. The function of this is not fully understood.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>Adult size and weight is largely determined by environmental factors; boars living in arid areas with little productivity tend to attain smaller sizes than their counterparts inhabiting areas with abundant food and water. In most of Europe, males average 75–100 kg (165–220 lb) in weight, 75–80 cm (30–31 in) in shoulder height and 150 cm (59 in) in body length, whereas females average 60–80 kg (130–180 lb) in weight, 70 cm (28 in) in shoulder height and 140 cm (55 in) in body length. In Europe\'s Mediterranean regions, males may reach average weights as low as 50 kg (110 lb) and females 45 kg (99 lb), with shoulder heights of 63–65 cm (25–26 in). In the more productive areas of Eastern Europe, males average 110–130 kg (240–290 lb) in weight, 95 cm (37 in) in shoulder height and 160 cm (63 in) in body length, while females weigh 95 kg (209 lb), reach 85–90 cm (33–35 in) in shoulder height and 145 cm (57 in) in body length. In Western and Central Europe, the largest males weigh 200 kg (440 lb) and females 120 kg (260 lb). In North-Eastern Asia, large males can reach brown bear-like sizes, weighing 270 kg (600 lb) and measuring 110–118 cm (43–46 in) in shoulder height. Some adult males in Ussuriland and Manchuria have been recorded to weigh 300–350 kg (660–770 lb) and measure 125 cm (49 in) in shoulder height. Adults of this size are generally immune from wolf predation. Such giants are rare in modern times, due to past overhunting preventing animals from attaining their full growth. The winter coat consists of long, coarse bristles underlaid with short brown downy fur. The length of these bristles varies along the body, with the shortest being around the face and limbs and the longest running along the back. These back bristles form the aforementioned mane prominent in males and stand erect when the animal is agitated. Colour is highly variable; specimens around Lake Balkhash are very lightly coloured, and can even be white, while some boars from Belarus and Ussuriland can be black. Some subspecies sport a light coloured patch running backward from the corners of the mouth. Coat colour also varies with age, with piglets having light brown or rusty-brown fur with pale bands extending from the flanks and back.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>The wild boar produces a number of different sounds which are divided into three categories:</p>\\r\\n\\t<ol>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tContact calls: Grunting noises which differ in intensity according to the situation. Adult males are usually silent, while females frequently grunt and piglets whine. When feeding, boars express their contentment through purring. Studies have shown that piglets imitate the sounds of their mother, thus different litters may have unique vocalisations.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tAlarm calls: Warning cries emitted in response to threats. When frightened, boars make loud huffing ukh! ukh! sounds or emit screeches transcribed as gu-gu-gu.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tCombat calls: High-pitched, piercing cries.</li>\\r\\n\\t</ol>\\r\\n\\t<p>Its sense of smell is very well developed, to the point that the animal is used for drug detection in Germany. Its hearing is also acute, though its eyesight is comparatively weak, lacking colour vision and being unable to recognise a standing human 10–15 metres away. Pigs are one of four known mammalian species which possess mutations in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that protect against snake venom. Mongooses, honey badgers, hedgehogs, and pigs all have modifications to the receptor pocket which prevents the snake venom α-neurotoxin from binding. These represent four separate, independent mutations.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>Social behavior and life cycle<br />\\r\\n\\t\\tBoars are typically social animals, living in female-dominated sounders consisting of barren sows and mothers with young led by an old matriarch. Male boars leave their sounder at the age of 8–15 months, while females either remain with their mothers or establish new territories nearby. Subadult males may live in loosely knit groups, while adult and elderly males tend to be solitary outside the breeding season. The breeding period in most areas lasts from November to January, though most mating only lasts a month and a half. Prior to mating, the males develop their subcutaneous armor, in preparation for confronting rivals. The testicles double in size and the glands secrete a foamy yellowish liquid. Once ready to reproduce, males travel long distances in search of a sounder of sows, eating little on the way. Once a sounder has been located, the male drives off all young animals and persistently chases the sows. At this point, the male fiercely fights potential rivals, A single male can mate with 5–10 sows. By the end of the rut, males are often badly mauled and have lost 20% of their body weight, with bite-induced injuries to the penis being common. The gestation period varies according to the age of the expecting mother. For first time breeders, it lasts 114–130 days, while it lasts 133–140 days in older sows. Farrowing occurs between March and May, with litter sizes depending on the age and nutrition of the mother. The average litter consists of 4–6 piglets, with the maximum being 10–12. The piglets are whelped in a nest constructed from twigs, grasses and leaves. Should the mother die prematurely, the piglets are adopted by the other sows in the sounder. Newborn piglets weigh around 600–1,000 grams, lacking underfur and bearing a single milk incisor and canine on each half of the jaw. There is intense competition between the piglets over the most milk-rich nipples, as the best fed young grow faster and have stronger constitutions. The piglets do not leave the lair for their first week of life. Should the mother be absent, the piglets lie closely pressed to each other. By two weeks of age, the piglets begin accompanying their mother on her journeys. Should danger be detected, the piglets take cover or stand immobile, relying on their camouflage to keep them hidden. The neonatal coat fades after three months, with adult colouration being attained at eight months. Although the lactation period lasts 2.5–3.5 months, the piglets begin displaying adult feeding behaviors at the age of 2–3 weeks. The permanent dentition is fully formed by 1–2 years. With the exception of the canines in males, the teeth stop growing during the middle of the fourth year. The canines in old males continue to grow throughout their lives, curving strongly as they age. Sows attain sexual maturity at the age of one year, with males attaining it a year later. However, estrus usually first occurs after two years in sows, while males begin participating in the rut after 4–5 years, as they are not permitted to mate by the older males. The maximum lifespan in the wild is 10–14 years, though few specimens survive past 4–5 years. Boars in captivity have lived for 20 years.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>Ecology<br />\\r\\n\\t\\tHabitat and sheltering behaviour<br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe wild boar inhabits a diverse array of habitats from boreal taigas to deserts. In mountainous regions, it can even occupy alpine zones, occurring up to 1,900 meters in the Carpathians, 2,600 meters in the Caucasus and up to 3,600–4,000 meters in the mountains in Central Asia and Kazakhstan. In order to survive in a given area, wild boars require a habitat fulfilling three conditions: heavily brushed areas providing shelter from predators, water for drinking and bathing purposes and an absence of regular snowfall. The main habitats favored by boars in Europe are deciduous and mixed forests, with the most favorable areas consisting of forest composed of oak and beech enclosing marshes and meadows. In the Białowieża Forest, the animal\'s primary habitat consists of well developed, broad-leaved and mixed forests, along with marshy mixed forests, with coniferous forests and undergrowths being of secondary importance. Forests made up entirely of oak groves and beeches are used only during the fruit-bearing season. This is in contrast to the Caucasian and Transcaucasian mountain areas, where boars will occupy such fruit-bearing forests year-round. In the mountainous areas of the Russian Far East, the species inhabits nutpine groves, hilly mixed forests where Mongolian oak and Korean pine are present, swampy mixed taiga and coastal oak forests. In Transbaikalia, boars are restricted to river valleys with nut pine and shrubs. Boars are regularly encountered in pistachio groves in winter in some areas of Tajikistan and Turkmenia, while in spring they migrate to open deserts; boar have also colonized deserts in several areas they have been introduced to. On the islands of Komodo and Rinca, the boar mostly inhabits savanna or open monsoon forests, avoiding heavily forested areas unless pursued by humans. Wild boar are known to be competent swimmers, capable of covering long distances. In 2013, one boar was reported to have completed the seven mile swim from France to Alderney in the Channel Islands. Due to concerns about disease it was shot and incinerated. Wild boar rest in shelters, which contain insulating material like spruce branches and dry hay. These resting places are occupied by whole families (though males lie separately), and are often located in the vicinity of streams, in swamp forests, in tall grass or shrub thickets. Boars never defecate in their shelters, and will cover themselves with soil and pine needles when irritated by insects.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>Diet<br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe wild boar is a highly versatile omnivore, whose diversity in choice of food rivals that of humans. Their foods can be divided into four categories:&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\t<ol>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tRhizomes, roots, tubers and bulbs, all of which are dug up throughout the year in the animal\'s whole range.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tNuts, berries, and seeds, which are consumed when ripened and are dug up from the snow when abundant.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tLeaves, bark, twigs, and shoots, along with garbage.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tEarthworms, insects, mollusks, fish, rodents, insectivores, bird eggs, lizards, snakes, frogs, and carrion. Most of these prey items are taken in warm periods.</li>\\r\\n\\t</ol>\\r\\n\\t<p>A 50 kg (110 lb) boar needs around 4,000–4,500 calories of food per day, though this required amount increases during winter and pregnancy, with the majority of its diet consisting of food items dug from the ground like underground plant material and burrowing animals. Acorns and beechnuts are invariably its most important food items in temperate zones, as they are rich in the carbohydrates necessary for the buildup of fat reserves needed to survive lean periods. In Western Europe, underground plant material favoured by boars includes bracken, willow herb, bulbs, meadow herb roots and bulbs, and the bulbs of cultivated crops. Such food is favoured in early spring and summer, but may also be eaten in autumn and winter during beechnut and acorn crop failures. Should regular wild foods become scarce, boars will eat tree bark and fungi, as well as visit cultivated potato and artichoke fields. Boar soil disturbance and foraging have been shown to facilitate invasive plants. Boars of the vittatus subspecies in Ujung Kulon National Park in Java differ from most other populations by their primarily frugivorous diet, which consists of 50 different fruit species, especially figs, thus making them important seed dispersers. The wild boar can consume numerous genera of poisonous plants without ill effect, including Aconitum, Anemone, Calla, Caltha, Ferula, and Pteridium. Boars may occasionally prey on small vertebrates like newborn deer fawns, leporids and galliform chicks. Boars inhabiting the Volga Delta and near some lakes and rivers of Kazakhstan have been recorded to feed extensively on fish like carp and Caspian roach. Boars in the former area will also feed on cormorant and heron chicks, bivalved molluscs, trapped muskrats and mice. There is at least one record of a boar killing and eating a bonnet macaque in southern India\'s Bandipur National Park, though this may have been a case of intraguild predation, brought on by interspecific competition for human handouts.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>Predators</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>Piglets are vulnerable to attack from medium-sized felids like lynx, jungle cats and snow leopards and other carnivorans like brown bears and yellow-throated martens. The grey wolf is the main predator of wild boar throughout most of its range. A single wolf can kill around 50 to 80 boars of differing ages in one year. In Italy and Belarus\' Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park, boars are the wolf\'s primary prey, despite an abundance of alternative, less powerful ungulates. Wolves are particularly threatening during the winter, when deep snow impedes the boars\' movements. In the Baltic regions, heavy snowfall can allow wolves to eliminate boars from an area almost completely. Wolves primarily target piglets and subadults, and only rarely attack adult sows. Adult males are usually avoided entirely. Dholes may also prey on boars, to the point of keeping their numbers down in northwestern Bhutan, despite there being many more cattle in the area. Leopards are predators of wild boar in the Caucasus, Transcaucasia, the Russian Far East, India, China, and Iran. In most areas, boars constitute only a small part of the leopard\'s diet. However, in Iran\'s Sarigol National Park, boars are the second most frequently targeted prey species after mouflon, though adult individuals are generally avoided, as they are above the leopard\'s preferred weight range of 10–40 kg (22–88 lb). This dependence on wild boar is largely due in part to the local leopard subspecies\' large size. Boars of all ages were once the primary prey of tigers in Transcaucasia, Kazakhstan, Middle Asia and the Far East up until the late 19th century. In modern times, tiger numbers are too low to have a limiting effect on boar populations. A single tiger can systematically destroy an entire sounder by preying on its members one by one, before moving on to another herd. Tigers have been noted to chase boars for longer distances than with other prey. In two rare cases, boars were reported to gore a small tiger and a tigress to death in self-defense. In the Amur region, wild boars are one of the two most important prey species for tigers alongside the Manchurian wapiti, with the two species collectively comprising roughly 80% of the felid\'s prey. In Sikhote Alin, a tiger can kill 30–34 boars a year. Studies of tigers in India indicate that boars are usually secondary in preference to various cervids and bovids, though when boars are targeted, healthy adults are caught more frequently than young and sick specimens. On the islands of Komodo, Rinca, and Flores, the boar\'s main predator is the Komodo dragon.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Range</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t<em>Reconstructed range</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe species originally occurred in North Africa and much of Eurasia; from the British Isles to Korea and the Sunda Islands. The northern limit of its range extended from southern Scandinavia to southern Siberia and Japan. Within this range, it was only absent in extremely dry deserts and alpine zones. It was once found in North Africa along the Nile valley up to Khartum and north of the Sahara. The species occurs on a few Ionian and Aegean Islands, sometimes swimming between islands. The reconstructed northern boundary of the animal\'s Asian range ran from Lake Ladoga (at 60°N) through the area of Novgorod and Moscow into the southern Urals, where it reached 52°N. From there, the boundary passed Ishim and farther east the Irtysh at 56°N. In the eastern Baraba steppe (near Novosibirsk) the boundary turned steep south, encircled the Altai Mountains, and went again eastward including the Tannu-Ola Mountains and Lake Baikal. From here the boundary went slightly north of the Amur River eastward to its lower reaches at the Sea of Okhotsk. On Sakhalin, there are only fossil reports of wild boar. The southern boundaries in Europe and Asia were almost invariably identical to the seashores of these continents. It is absent in the dry regions of Mongolia from 44–46°N southward, in China westward of Sichuan and in India north of the Himalayas. It is absent in the higher elevations of Pamir and Tien Shan, though they do occur in the Tarim basin and on the lower slopes of the Tien Shan.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><em>Present range</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tIn recent centuries, the range of wild boar has changed dramatically, largely due to hunting by humans and more recently because of captive wild boar escaping into the wild. Prior to the 20th century, boar populations had declined in numerous areas, with British populations probably becoming extinct during the 13th century. In Denmark, the last boar was shot at the beginning of the 19th century, and in 1900 they were absent in Tunisia and Sudan and large areas of Germany, Austria, and Italy. In Russia, they were extirpated in wide areas in the 1930s. The last boar in Egypt reportedly died on 20 December 1912 in the Giza Zoo, with wild populations having disappeared around 1894–1902. Prince Kamal el Dine Hussein attempted to repopulate Wadi El Natrun with boars of Hungarian stock, but they were quickly exterminated by poachers. A revival of boar populations began in the middle of the 20th century. By 1950 wild boar had once again reached their original northern boundary in many parts of their Asiatic range. By 1960, they reached Leningrad and Moscow, and by 1975 they were to be found in Archangelsk and Astrakhan. In the 1970s they again occurred in Denmark and Sweden, where captive animals escaped and now survive in the wild. In England, wild boar populations re-established themselves in the 1990s, after escaping from specialist farms that had imported European stock.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><em>Status in Britain</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tWild boars were apparently already becoming rare by the 11th century since a 1087 forestry law enacted by William the Conqueror punishes through blinding the unlawful killing of a boar. Charles I attempted to reintroduce the species into the New Forest, though this population was exterminated during the Civil War. Between their medieval extinction and the 1980s, when wild boar farming began, only a handful of captive wild boar, imported from the continent, were present in Britain. Occasional escapes of wild boar from wildlife parks have occurred as early as the 1970s, but since the early 1990s significant populations have re-established themselves after escapes from farms, the number of which has increased as the demand for meat from the species has grown. A 1998 MAFF (now DEFRA) study on wild boar living wild in Britain confirmed the presence of two populations of wild boar living in Britain; one in Kent/East Sussex and another in Dorset. Another DEFRA report, in February 2008, confirmed the existence of these two sites as \'established breeding areas\' and identified a third in Gloucestershire/Herefordshire; in the Forest of Dean/Ross on Wye area. A \'new breeding population\' was also identified in Devon. There is another significant population in Dumfries and Galloway. Populations estimates were as follows:</p>\\r\\n\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tThe largest population, in Kent/East Sussex, was then estimated at approximately 200 animals in the core distribution area.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tThe second largest, in Gloucestershire/Herefordshire, was first estimated to be in excess of 100 animals. Legally classified as dangerous wild animals, the group is known to be feral descendants of domestic (Tamworth) pigs abandoned nearby. Their numbers grew by 2016 to at least 1500 and the Forestry Commission planned to reduce the total to a manageable 400. \\"Adult males can reach twenty stone (125 kg), run at thirty miles an hour, and can jump or barge through all but the strongest fences. Also, they are not afraid of humans, so (unlike deer) you can\'t just shoo them out of your garden.\\"</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tThe smallest, in west Dorset, was estimated to be fewer than 50 animals.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tSince winter 2005/6 significant escapes/releases have also resulted in animals colonizing areas around the fringes of Dartmoor, in Devon. These are considered as an additional single \'new breeding population\' and currently estimated to be up to 100 animals.</li>\\r\\n\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t<p>Population estimates for the Forest of Dean are disputed as at the time that the DEFRA population estimate was 100, a photo of a boar sounder in the forest near Staunton with over 33 animals visible was published, and at about the same time over 30 boar were seen in a field near the original escape location of Weston under Penyard many miles away. In early 2010 the Forestry Commission embarked on a cull, with the aim of reducing the boar population from an estimated 150 animals to 100. By August it was stated that efforts were being made to reduce the population from 200 to 90, but that only 25 had been killed.The failure to meet cull targets was confirmed in February 2011. Wild boars have crossed the River Wye into Monmouthshire, Wales. Iolo Williams, the BBC Wales wildlife expert, attempted to film Welsh boar in late 2012. Many other sightings, across the UK, have also been reported. The effects of wild boar on the UK\'s woodlands were discussed with Ralph Harmer of the Forestry Commission on the BBC Radio\'s Farming Today radio programme in 2011. The programme prompted activist writer George Monbiot to propose a thorough population study, followed by the introduction of permit-controlled culling.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><em>Introduction to North America</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tWild boars are an invasive species in the Americas, and cause problems including outcompeting native species for food, destroying the nests of ground-nesting species, killing fawns and young domestic livestock, destroying agricultural crops, eating tree seeds and seedlings, destroying native vegetation and wetlands through wallowing, damaging water quality, coming into violent conflict with humans and pets, and carrying pig and human diseases including brucellosis, trichinosis, and pseudorabies. In some jurisdictions, it is illegal to import, breed, release, possess, sell, distribute, trade, transport, hunt, or trap Eurasian boars. Hunting and trapping is done systematically, to increase the chance of eradication and to remove the incentive to illegally release boars, which have mostly been spread deliberately by sport hunters.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>History<br />\\r\\n\\t\\tWhile domestic pigs, both captive and feral (popularly termed \\"razorbacks\\"), have been in North America since the earliest days of European colonization, pure wild boars were not introduced into the New World until the 19th century. The suids were released into the wild by wealthy landowners as big game animals. The initial introductions took place in fenced enclosures, though several escapes occurred, with the escapees sometimes intermixing with already established feral pig populations. The first of these introductions occurred in New Hampshire in 1890. Thirteen wild boars from Germany were purchased by Austin Corbin from Carl Hagenbeck, and released into a 9,500-hectare game preserve in Sullivan County. Several of these boars escaped, though they were quickly hunted down by locals. Two further introductions were made from the original stocking, with several escapes taking place due to breaches in the game preserve\'s fencing. These escapees have ranged widely, with some specimens having been observed crossing into Vermont. In 1902, 15–20 wild boar from Germany were released into a 3,200-hectare estate in Hamilton County, New York. Several specimens escaped six years later, dispersing into the William C. Whitney Wilderness Area, with their descendants surviving for at least 20 years. The most extensive boar introduction in the US took place in western North Carolina in 1912, when 13 boars of undetermined European origin were released into two fenced enclosures in a game preserve in Hooper Bald, Graham County. Most of the specimens remained in the preserve for the next decade, until a large-scale hunt caused the remaining animals to break through their confines and escape. Some of the boars migrated to Tennessee, where they intermixed with both free-ranging and feral pigs in the area. In 1924, a dozen Hooper Bald wild pigs were shipped to California and released in a property between Carmel Valley and the Los Padres National Forest. These hybrid boar were later used as breeding stock on various private and public lands throughout the state, as well as in other states like Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, West Virginia and Mississippi. Several wild boars from Leon Springs and the San Antonio, Saint Louis and San Diego Zoos were released in the Powder Horn Ranch in Calhoun County, Texas, in 1939. These specimens escaped and established themselves in surrounding ranchlands and coastal areas, with some crossing the Espiritu Santo Bay and colonizing Matagorda Island. Descendants of the Powder Horn Ranch boars were later released onto San José Island and the coast of Chalmette, Louisiana. Wild boar of unknown origin were stocked in a ranch in the Edwards Plateau in the 1940s, only to escape during a storm and hybridize with local feral pig populations, later spreading into neighboring counties. Starting in the mid-80s, several boars purchased from the San Diego Zoo and Tierpark Berlin were released into the United States. A decade later, more specimens from farms in Canada and Białowieża Forest was let loose. In recent years, wild pig populations have been reported in 44 states within the US, most of which are likely wild boar–feral hog hybrids. Pure wild boar populations may still be present, but are extremely localized.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Diseases and parasites</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tWild boars are known to host at least 20 different parasitic worm species, with maximum infections occurring in summer. Young animals are vulnerable to helminths like Metastrongylus, which are consumed by boars through earthworms, and cause death by parasitising the lungs. Wild boar also carry parasites known to infect humans, including Gastrodiscoides, Trichinella spiralis, Taenia solium, and Balantidium coli. Wild boar in southern regions are frequently infested with ticks (Dermacentor, Rhipicephalus, and Hyalomma) and hog lice. The species also suffers from blood-sucking flies, which it escapes by bathing frequently or hiding in dense shrubs. Swine plague spreads very quickly in wild boar, with epizootics being recorded in Germany, Poland, Hungary, Belarus, the Caucasus, the Far East, Kazakhstan, and other regions. Foot-and-mouth disease can also take on epidemic proportions in boar populations. The species occasionally, but rarely contracts Pasteurellosis, hemorrhagic septicemia, tularemia and anthrax. Wild boar may on occasion contract swine erysipelas through rodents or hog lice and ticks.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Relationships with humans</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tIn culture The wild boar features prominently in the cultures of Indo-European people, many of which saw the animal as embodying warrior virtues. Cultures throughout Europe and Asia Minor saw the killing of a boar as proof of one\'s valor and strength. Neolithic hunter gatherers depicted reliefs of ferocious wild boars on their temple pillars at Göbekli Tepe some 11,600 years ago. Virtually all heroes in Greek mythology fight or kill a boar at one point. The demigod Herakles\' third labour involves the capture of the Erymanthian Boar, Theseus slays the wild sow Phaea, and a disguised Odysseus is recognised by his handmaiden Eurycleia by the scars inflicted on him by a boar during a hunt in his youth. To the mythical Hyperboreans, the boar represented spiritual authority. Several Greek myths use the boar as a symbol of darkness, death, and winter. One example is the story of the youthful Adonis, who is killed by a boar and is permitted by Zeus to depart from Hades only during the spring and summer period. This theme also occurs in Irish and Egyptian mythology, where the animal is explicitly linked to the month of October, therefore autumn. This association likely arose from aspects of the boar\'s actual nature. Its dark colour was linked to the night, while its solitary habits, proclivity to consume crops and nocturnal nature were associated with evil. The foundation myth of Ephesus has the city being built over the site where prince Androklos of Athens killed a boar. Boars were frequently depicted on Greek funerary monuments alongside lions, representing gallant losers who have finally met their match, as opposed to victorious hunters as lions are. The theme of the doomed, yet valorous boar warrior also occurred in Hittite culture, where it was traditional to sacrifice a boar alongside a dog and a prisoner of war after a military defeat. The boar as a warrior also appears in Scandinavian, Germanic and Anglo-Saxon culture, with its image having been frequently engraved on helmets, shields, and swords. According to Tacitus, the Baltic Aesti featured boars on their helmets, and may have also worn boar masks (see for example the Guilden Morden boar). The boar and pig were held in particularly high esteem by the Celts, who considered them to be their most important sacred animal. Some Celtic deities linked to boars include Moccus and Veteris. It has been suggested that some early myths surrounding the Welsh hero Culhwch involved the character being the son of a boar god. Nevertheless, the importance of the boar as a culinary item among Celtic tribes may have been exaggerated in popular culture by the Asterix series, as wild boar bones are rare among Celtic archaeological sites, and the few that occur show no signs of butchery, having probably been used in sacrificial rituals. The boar also appears in Vedic mythology. A story present in the Brāhmaṇas has Indra slaying an avaricious boar, who has stolen the treasure of the asuras, then giving its carcass to Vishnu, who offered it as a sacrifice to the gods. In the story\'s retelling in the Charaka Samhita, the boar is described as a form of Prajāpti, and is credited with having raised the earth from the primeval waters. In the Rāmāyaṇa and the Purāṇas, the same boar is portrayed as an avatar of Vishnu. In Japanese culture, the boar is widely seen as a fearsome and reckless animal, to the point that several words and expressions in Japanese referring to recklessness include references to boars. The boar is the last animal of the oriental zodiac, with people born during the year of the Pig being said to embody the boar-like traits of determination and impetuosity. Among Japanese hunters, the boar\'s courage and defiance is a source of admiration, and it is not uncommon for hunters and mountain people to name their sons after the animal inoshishi (猪). Boars are also seen as symbols of fertility and prosperity; in some regions, it is thought that boars are drawn to fields owned by families including pregnant women, and hunters with pregnant wives are thought to have greater chances of success when boar hunting. The animal\'s link to prosperity was illustrated by its inclusion on the ¥10 note during the Meiji period, and it was once believed that a man could become wealthy by keeping a clump of boar hair in his wallet. In the folklore of the Mongol Altai Uriankhai tribe, the wild boar was associated with the watery underworld, as it was thought that the spirits of the dead entered the animal\'s head, to be ultimately transported to the water. Prior to the conversion to Islam, the Kyrgyz people believed that they were descended from boars, and thus did not eat pork. In Buryat mythology, the forefathers of the Buryats descended from heaven and were nourished by a boar. In China, the boar is the emblem of the Miao people. The boar (sanglier) is frequently displayed in English, Scottish and Welsh heraldry. As with the lion, the boar is often shown as armed and langued. As with the bear, Scottish and Welsh heraldry displays the boar\'s head with the neck cropped, unlike the English version, which retains the neck. The white boar served as the badge of King Richard III of England, who distributed it among his northern retainers during his tenure as Duke of Gloucester.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><em>As a game animal and food source</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tHumans have been hunting boar for millennia, with the earliest artistic depictions of such activities dating back to the Upper Paleolithic. The animal was seen as a source of food among the Ancient Greeks, as well as a sporting challenge and source of epic narratives. The Romans inherited this tradition, with one of its first practitioners being Scipio Aemilianus. Boar hunting became particularly popular among the young nobility during the 3rd century BC as preparation for manhood and battle. A typical Roman boar hunting tactic involved surrounding a given area with large nets, then flushing the boar with dogs and immobilizing it with smaller nets. The animal would then be dispatched with a venabulum, a short spear with a crossguard at the base of the blade. More than their Greek predecessors, the Romans extensively took inspiration from boar hunting in their art and sculpture. With the ascension of Constantine the Great, boar hunting took on Christian allegorical themes, with the animal being portrayed as a \\"black beast\\" analogous to the dragon of Saint George. Boar hunting continued after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, though the Germanic tribes considered the red deer to be a more noble and worthy quarry. The post-Roman nobility hunted boar as their predecessors did, but primarily as training for battle rather than sport. It was not uncommon for medieval hunters to deliberately hunt boars during the breeding season when the animals were more aggressive. During the Renaissance, when deforestation and the introduction of firearms reduced boar numbers, boarhunting became the sole prerogative of the nobility, one of many charges brought up against the rich during the German Peasants\' War and the French Revolution. During the mid-20th century, 7,000–8,000 boars were caught in the Caucasus, 6,000–7,000 in Kazakhstan, and about 5,000 in Central Asia during the Soviet period, primarily through use of dogs and beats. In Nepal, farmers and poachers eliminate boars by baiting balls of wheat flour containing explosives with kerosene oil, with the animals\' chewing motions triggering the devices. Wild boar can thrive in captivity, though piglets grow slowly and poorly without their mothers. Products derived from wild boar include meat, hide and bristles. Apicius devotes a whole chapter to the cooking of boar meat, providing ten recipes involving roasting, boiling and what sauces to use. The Romans usually served boar meat with garum. Boar\'s head was the centrepiece of most medieval Christmas celebrations among the nobility. Although growing in popularity as a captive-bred source of food, the wild boar takes longer to mature than most domestic pigs, and is usually smaller and produces less meat. Nevertheless, wild boar meat is leaner and healthier than pork, being of higher nutritional value and having a much higher concentration of essential amino acids. Most meat-dressing organizations agree that a boar carcass should yield 50 kg (110 lb) of meat on average. Large specimens can yield 15–20 kg (33–44 lb) of fat, with some giants yielding 30 kg (66 lb) or more. A boar hide can measure 300 dm2, and can yield 350–1000 grams of bristle and 400 grams of underwool.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><em>Crop and garbage raiding</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tBoars can be damaging to agriculture. Populations living on the outskirts of towns or farms can dig up potatoes and damage melons, watermelons and maize. They generally only encroach upon farms when natural food is scarce. In the Belovezh forest for example, 34–47% of the local boar population will enter fields in years of moderate availability of natural foods. While the role of boars in damaging crops is often exaggerated, cases are known of boar depredations causing famines, as was the case in Hachinohe, Japan in 1749, where 3,000 people died of what became known as the \'wild boar famine\'. Still, within Japanese culture, the boar\'s status as vermin is expressed through its title as \\"king of pests\\" and the popular saying (addressed to young men in rural areas) \\"When you get married, choose a place with no wild boar.\\" In Central Europe, farmers typically repel boars through distraction or fright, while in Kazakhstan it is usual to employ guard dogs in plantations. Although large boar populations can play an important role in limiting forest growth, they are also useful in keeping pest populations such as June bugs under control. The growth of urban areas and the corresponding decline in natural boar habitats has led to some sounders entering human habitations in search of food. As in natural conditions, sounders in peri-urban areas are matriarchal, though males tend to be much less represented, and adults of both sexes can be up to 35% heavier than their forest-dwelling counterparts. As of 2010, at least 44 cities in 15 countries have experienced problems of some kind relating to the presence of habituated wild boar.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><em>Attacks on humans</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tActual attacks on humans are rare, but can be serious, resulting in multiple penetrating injuries to the lower part of the body. They generally occur during the boars\' rutting season from November to January, in agricultural areas bordering forests or on paths leading through forests. The animal typically attacks by charging and pointing its tusks towards the intended victim, with most injuries occurring on the thigh region. Once the initial attack is over, the boar steps back, takes position and attacks again if the victim is still moving, only ending once the victim is completely incapacitated. Boar attacks on humans have been documented since the Stone Age, with one of the oldest depictions being a cave painting in Bhimbetaka, India. The Romans and Ancient Greeks wrote of these attacks (Odysseus was wounded by a boar, and Adonis was killed by one). A 2012 study compiling recorded attacks from 1825–2012 found accounts of 665 human victims of both wild boars and feral pigs, with the majority (19%) of attacks in the animal\'s native range occurring in India. Most of the attacks occurred in rural areas during the winter months in non-hunting contexts and were committed by solitary males.</p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n",

            \'safe_value\' => "<p>As true wild boars became extinct in Britain before the development of modern English, the same terms are often used for both true wild boar and pigs, especially large or semi-wild ones. The English \'boar\' stems from the Old English bar, which is thought to be derived from the West Germanic *bairaz, of unknown origin. Boar is sometimes used specifically to refer to males, and may also be used to refer to male domesticated pigs, especially breeding males that have not been castrated. \'Sow\', the traditional name for a female, again comes from Old English and Germanic; it stems from Proto-Indo-European, and is related to the Latin sus and Greek hus and more closely to the modern German Sau. The young may be called \'piglets\'. The animals\' specific name scrofa is Latin for \'sow\'.</p>\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\n<p>Taxonomy and evolution<br />\\n\\t\\tMtDNA studies indicate that the wild boar originated from islands in Southeast Asia such as Indonesia and the Philippines, and subsequently spread onto mainland Eurasia and North Africa. The earliest fossil finds of the species come from both Europe and Asia, and date back to the Early Pleistocene. By the late Villafranchian, S. scrofa largely displaced the related S. strozzii, a large, possibly swamp-adapted suid ancestral to the modern S. verrucosus throughout the Eurasian mainland, restricting it to insular Asia. Its closest wild relative is the bearded pig of Malacca and surrounding islands.</p>\\n<p>Domestication<br />\\n\\t\\tWith the exception of domestic pigs in Timor and Papua New Guinea (which appear to be of Sulawesi warty pig stock), the wild boar is the ancestor of most pig breeds. Archaeological evidence suggests that pigs were domesticated from wild boar as early as 13,000–12,700 BC in the Near East in the Tigris Basin being managed in the wild in a way similar to the way they are managed by some modern New Guineans. Remains of pigs have been dated to earlier than 11,400 BC in Cyprus. Those animals must have been introduced from the mainland, which suggests domestication in the adjacent mainland by then. There was also a separate domestication in China which took place about 8000 years ago. DNA evidence from sub-fossil remains of teeth and jawbones of Neolithic pigs shows that the first domestic pigs in Europe had been brought from the Near East. This stimulated the domestication of local European wild boar resulting in a third domestication event with the Near Eastern genes dying out in European pig stock. Modern domesticated pigs have involved complex exchanges, with European domesticated lines being exported in turn to the ancient Near East. Historical records indicate that Asian pigs were introduced into Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries. Domestic pigs tend to have much more developed hindquarters than their wild boar ancestors, to the point where 70% of their body weight is concentrated in the posterior, which is the opposite of wild boar, where most of the muscles are concentrated on the head and shoulders.</p>\\n<p>Physical description<br />\\n\\t\\tThe wild boar is a bulky, massively built suid with short and relatively thin legs. The trunk is short and massive, while the hindquarters are comparatively underdeveloped. The region behind the shoulder blades rises into a hump, and the neck is short and thick, to the point of being nearly immobile. The animal\'s head is very large, taking up to one third of the body\'s entire length. The structure of the head is well suited for digging. The head acts as a plough, while the powerful neck muscles allow the animal to upturn considerable amounts of soil: it is capable of digging 8–10 cm (3.1–3.9 in) into frozen ground and can upturn rocks weighing 40–50 kg (88–110 lb). The eyes are small and deep-set, and the ears long and broad. The species has well developed canine teeth, which protrude from the mouths of adult males. The middle hooves are larger and more elongated than the lateral ones, and are capable of quick movements. The animal can run at a maximum speed of 40 km/h and jump at a height of 140–150 cm (55–59 in). Sexual dimorphism is very pronounced in the species, with males being typically 5–10% larger and 20–30% heavier than females. Males also sport a mane running down the back, which is particularly apparent during autumn and winter. The canine teeth are also much more prominent in males, and grow throughout life. The upper canines are relatively short and grow sideways early in life, though gradually curve upwards. The lower canines are much sharper and longer, with the exposed parts measuring 10–12 cm (3.9–4.7 in) in length. In the breeding period, males develop a coating of subcutaneous tissue, which may be 2–3 cm (0.79–1.18 in) thick, extending from the shoulder blades to the rump, thus protecting vital organs during fights. Males sport a roughly egg-sized sack near the opening of the penis, which collects urine and emits a sharp odour. The function of this is not fully understood.</p>\\n<p>Adult size and weight is largely determined by environmental factors; boars living in arid areas with little productivity tend to attain smaller sizes than their counterparts inhabiting areas with abundant food and water. In most of Europe, males average 75–100 kg (165–220 lb) in weight, 75–80 cm (30–31 in) in shoulder height and 150 cm (59 in) in body length, whereas females average 60–80 kg (130–180 lb) in weight, 70 cm (28 in) in shoulder height and 140 cm (55 in) in body length. In Europe\'s Mediterranean regions, males may reach average weights as low as 50 kg (110 lb) and females 45 kg (99 lb), with shoulder heights of 63–65 cm (25–26 in). In the more productive areas of Eastern Europe, males average 110–130 kg (240–290 lb) in weight, 95 cm (37 in) in shoulder height and 160 cm (63 in) in body length, while females weigh 95 kg (209 lb), reach 85–90 cm (33–35 in) in shoulder height and 145 cm (57 in) in body length. In Western and Central Europe, the largest males weigh 200 kg (440 lb) and females 120 kg (260 lb). In North-Eastern Asia, large males can reach brown bear-like sizes, weighing 270 kg (600 lb) and measuring 110–118 cm (43–46 in) in shoulder height. Some adult males in Ussuriland and Manchuria have been recorded to weigh 300–350 kg (660–770 lb) and measure 125 cm (49 in) in shoulder height. Adults of this size are generally immune from wolf predation. Such giants are rare in modern times, due to past overhunting preventing animals from attaining their full growth. The winter coat consists of long, coarse bristles underlaid with short brown downy fur. The length of these bristles varies along the body, with the shortest being around the face and limbs and the longest running along the back. These back bristles form the aforementioned mane prominent in males and stand erect when the animal is agitated. Colour is highly variable; specimens around Lake Balkhash are very lightly coloured, and can even be white, while some boars from Belarus and Ussuriland can be black. Some subspecies sport a light coloured patch running backward from the corners of the mouth. Coat colour also varies with age, with piglets having light brown or rusty-brown fur with pale bands extending from the flanks and back.</p>\\n<p>The wild boar produces a number of different sounds which are divided into three categories:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n\\t\\t\\tContact calls: Grunting noises which differ in intensity according to the situation. Adult males are usually silent, while females frequently grunt and piglets whine. When feeding, boars express their contentment through purring. Studies have shown that piglets imitate the sounds of their mother, thus different litters may have unique vocalisations.</li>\\n<li>\\n\\t\\t\\tAlarm calls: Warning cries emitted in response to threats. When frightened, boars make loud huffing ukh! ukh! sounds or emit screeches transcribed as gu-gu-gu.</li>\\n<li>\\n\\t\\t\\tCombat calls: High-pitched, piercing cries.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Its sense of smell is very well developed, to the point that the animal is used for drug detection in Germany. Its hearing is also acute, though its eyesight is comparatively weak, lacking colour vision and being unable to recognise a standing human 10–15 metres away. Pigs are one of four known mammalian species which possess mutations in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that protect against snake venom. Mongooses, honey badgers, hedgehogs, and pigs all have modifications to the receptor pocket which prevents the snake venom α-neurotoxin from binding. These represent four separate, independent mutations.</p>\\n<p>Social behavior and life cycle<br />\\n\\t\\tBoars are typically social animals, living in female-dominated sounders consisting of barren sows and mothers with young led by an old matriarch. Male boars leave their sounder at the age of 8–15 months, while females either remain with their mothers or establish new territories nearby. Subadult males may live in loosely knit groups, while adult and elderly males tend to be solitary outside the breeding season. The breeding period in most areas lasts from November to January, though most mating only lasts a month and a half. Prior to mating, the males develop their subcutaneous armor, in preparation for confronting rivals. The testicles double in size and the glands secrete a foamy yellowish liquid. Once ready to reproduce, males travel long distances in search of a sounder of sows, eating little on the way. Once a sounder has been located, the male drives off all young animals and persistently chases the sows. At this point, the male fiercely fights potential rivals, A single male can mate with 5–10 sows. By the end of the rut, males are often badly mauled and have lost 20% of their body weight, with bite-induced injuries to the penis being common. The gestation period varies according to the age of the expecting mother. For first time breeders, it lasts 114–130 days, while it lasts 133–140 days in older sows. Farrowing occurs between March and May, with litter sizes depending on the age and nutrition of the mother. The average litter consists of 4–6 piglets, with the maximum being 10–12. The piglets are whelped in a nest constructed from twigs, grasses and leaves. Should the mother die prematurely, the piglets are adopted by the other sows in the sounder. Newborn piglets weigh around 600–1,000 grams, lacking underfur and bearing a single milk incisor and canine on each half of the jaw. There is intense competition between the piglets over the most milk-rich nipples, as the best fed young grow faster and have stronger constitutions. The piglets do not leave the lair for their first week of life. Should the mother be absent, the piglets lie closely pressed to each other. By two weeks of age, the piglets begin accompanying their mother on her journeys. Should danger be detected, the piglets take cover or stand immobile, relying on their camouflage to keep them hidden. The neonatal coat fades after three months, with adult colouration being attained at eight months. Although the lactation period lasts 2.5–3.5 months, the piglets begin displaying adult feeding behaviors at the age of 2–3 weeks. The permanent dentition is fully formed by 1–2 years. With the exception of the canines in males, the teeth stop growing during the middle of the fourth year. The canines in old males continue to grow throughout their lives, curving strongly as they age. Sows attain sexual maturity at the age of one year, with males attaining it a year later. However, estrus usually first occurs after two years in sows, while males begin participating in the rut after 4–5 years, as they are not permitted to mate by the older males. The maximum lifespan in the wild is 10–14 years, though few specimens survive past 4–5 years. Boars in captivity have lived for 20 years.</p>\\n<p>Ecology<br />\\n\\t\\tHabitat and sheltering behaviour<br />\\n\\t\\tThe wild boar inhabits a diverse array of habitats from boreal taigas to deserts. In mountainous regions, it can even occupy alpine zones, occurring up to 1,900 meters in the Carpathians, 2,600 meters in the Caucasus and up to 3,600–4,000 meters in the mountains in Central Asia and Kazakhstan. In order to survive in a given area, wild boars require a habitat fulfilling three conditions: heavily brushed areas providing shelter from predators, water for drinking and bathing purposes and an absence of regular snowfall. The main habitats favored by boars in Europe are deciduous and mixed forests, with the most favorable areas consisting of forest composed of oak and beech enclosing marshes and meadows. In the Białowieża Forest, the animal\'s primary habitat consists of well developed, broad-leaved and mixed forests, along with marshy mixed forests, with coniferous forests and undergrowths being of secondary importance. Forests made up entirely of oak groves and beeches are used only during the fruit-bearing season. This is in contrast to the Caucasian and Transcaucasian mountain areas, where boars will occupy such fruit-bearing forests year-round. In the mountainous areas of the Russian Far East, the species inhabits nutpine groves, hilly mixed forests where Mongolian oak and Korean pine are present, swampy mixed taiga and coastal oak forests. In Transbaikalia, boars are restricted to river valleys with nut pine and shrubs. Boars are regularly encountered in pistachio groves in winter in some areas of Tajikistan and Turkmenia, while in spring they migrate to open deserts; boar have also colonized deserts in several areas they have been introduced to. On the islands of Komodo and Rinca, the boar mostly inhabits savanna or open monsoon forests, avoiding heavily forested areas unless pursued by humans. Wild boar are known to be competent swimmers, capable of covering long distances. In 2013, one boar was reported to have completed the seven mile swim from France to Alderney in the Channel Islands. Due to concerns about disease it was shot and incinerated. Wild boar rest in shelters, which contain insulating material like spruce branches and dry hay. These resting places are occupied by whole families (though males lie separately), and are often located in the vicinity of streams, in swamp forests, in tall grass or shrub thickets. Boars never defecate in their shelters, and will cover themselves with soil and pine needles when irritated by insects.</p>\\n<p>Diet<br />\\n\\t\\tThe wild boar is a highly versatile omnivore, whose diversity in choice of food rivals that of humans. Their foods can be divided into four categories: </p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n\\t\\t\\tRhizomes, roots, tubers and bulbs, all of which are dug up throughout the year in the animal\'s whole range.</li>\\n<li>\\n\\t\\t\\tNuts, berries, and seeds, which are consumed when ripened and are dug up from the snow when abundant.</li>\\n<li>\\n\\t\\t\\tLeaves, bark, twigs, and shoots, along with garbage.</li>\\n<li>\\n\\t\\t\\tEarthworms, insects, mollusks, fish, rodents, insectivores, bird eggs, lizards, snakes, frogs, and carrion. Most of these prey items are taken in warm periods.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>A 50 kg (110 lb) boar needs around 4,000–4,500 calories of food per day, though this required amount increases during winter and pregnancy, with the majority of its diet consisting of food items dug from the ground like underground plant material and burrowing animals. Acorns and beechnuts are invariably its most important food items in temperate zones, as they are rich in the carbohydrates necessary for the buildup of fat reserves needed to survive lean periods. In Western Europe, underground plant material favoured by boars includes bracken, willow herb, bulbs, meadow herb roots and bulbs, and the bulbs of cultivated crops. Such food is favoured in early spring and summer, but may also be eaten in autumn and winter during beechnut and acorn crop failures. Should regular wild foods become scarce, boars will eat tree bark and fungi, as well as visit cultivated potato and artichoke fields. Boar soil disturbance and foraging have been shown to facilitate invasive plants. Boars of the vittatus subspecies in Ujung Kulon National Park in Java differ from most other populations by their primarily frugivorous diet, which consists of 50 different fruit species, especially figs, thus making them important seed dispersers. The wild boar can consume numerous genera of poisonous plants without ill effect, including Aconitum, Anemone, Calla, Caltha, Ferula, and Pteridium. Boars may occasionally prey on small vertebrates like newborn deer fawns, leporids and galliform chicks. Boars inhabiting the Volga Delta and near some lakes and rivers of Kazakhstan have been recorded to feed extensively on fish like carp and Caspian roach. Boars in the former area will also feed on cormorant and heron chicks, bivalved molluscs, trapped muskrats and mice. There is at least one record of a boar killing and eating a bonnet macaque in southern India\'s Bandipur National Park, though this may have been a case of intraguild predation, brought on by interspecific competition for human handouts.</p>\\n<p>Predators</p>\\n<p>Piglets are vulnerable to attack from medium-sized felids like lynx, jungle cats and snow leopards and other carnivorans like brown bears and yellow-throated martens. The grey wolf is the main predator of wild boar throughout most of its range. A single wolf can kill around 50 to 80 boars of differing ages in one year. In Italy and Belarus\' Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park, boars are the wolf\'s primary prey, despite an abundance of alternative, less powerful ungulates. Wolves are particularly threatening during the winter, when deep snow impedes the boars\' movements. In the Baltic regions, heavy snowfall can allow wolves to eliminate boars from an area almost completely. Wolves primarily target piglets and subadults, and only rarely attack adult sows. Adult males are usually avoided entirely. Dholes may also prey on boars, to the point of keeping their numbers down in northwestern Bhutan, despite there being many more cattle in the area. Leopards are predators of wild boar in the Caucasus, Transcaucasia, the Russian Far East, India, China, and Iran. In most areas, boars constitute only a small part of the leopard\'s diet. However, in Iran\'s Sarigol National Park, boars are the second most frequently targeted prey species after mouflon, though adult individuals are generally avoided, as they are above the leopard\'s preferred weight range of 10–40 kg (22–88 lb). This dependence on wild boar is largely due in part to the local leopard subspecies\' large size. Boars of all ages were once the primary prey of tigers in Transcaucasia, Kazakhstan, Middle Asia and the Far East up until the late 19th century. In modern times, tiger numbers are too low to have a limiting effect on boar populations. A single tiger can systematically destroy an entire sounder by preying on its members one by one, before moving on to another herd. Tigers have been noted to chase boars for longer distances than with other prey. In two rare cases, boars were reported to gore a small tiger and a tigress to death in self-defense. In the Amur region, wild boars are one of the two most important prey species for tigers alongside the Manchurian wapiti, with the two species collectively comprising roughly 80% of the felid\'s prey. In Sikhote Alin, a tiger can kill 30–34 boars a year. Studies of tigers in India indicate that boars are usually secondary in preference to various cervids and bovids, though when boars are targeted, healthy adults are caught more frequently than young and sick specimens. On the islands of Komodo, Rinca, and Flores, the boar\'s main predator is the Komodo dragon.</p>\\n<p><u>Range</u><br />\\n\\t\\t<em>Reconstructed range</em><br />\\n\\t\\tThe species originally occurred in North Africa and much of Eurasia; from the British Isles to Korea and the Sunda Islands. The northern limit of its range extended from southern Scandinavia to southern Siberia and Japan. Within this range, it was only absent in extremely dry deserts and alpine zones. It was once found in North Africa along the Nile valley up to Khartum and north of the Sahara. The species occurs on a few Ionian and Aegean Islands, sometimes swimming between islands. The reconstructed northern boundary of the animal\'s Asian range ran from Lake Ladoga (at 60°N) through the area of Novgorod and Moscow into the southern Urals, where it reached 52°N. From there, the boundary passed Ishim and farther east the Irtysh at 56°N. In the eastern Baraba steppe (near Novosibirsk) the boundary turned steep south, encircled the Altai Mountains, and went again eastward including the Tannu-Ola Mountains and Lake Baikal. From here the boundary went slightly north of the Amur River eastward to its lower reaches at the Sea of Okhotsk. On Sakhalin, there are only fossil reports of wild boar. The southern boundaries in Europe and Asia were almost invariably identical to the seashores of these continents. It is absent in the dry regions of Mongolia from 44–46°N southward, in China westward of Sichuan and in India north of the Himalayas. It is absent in the higher elevations of Pamir and Tien Shan, though they do occur in the Tarim basin and on the lower slopes of the Tien Shan.</p>\\n<p><em>Present range</em><br />\\n\\t\\tIn recent centuries, the range of wild boar has changed dramatically, largely due to hunting by humans and more recently because of captive wild boar escaping into the wild. Prior to the 20th century, boar populations had declined in numerous areas, with British populations probably becoming extinct during the 13th century. In Denmark, the last boar was shot at the beginning of the 19th century, and in 1900 they were absent in Tunisia and Sudan and large areas of Germany, Austria, and Italy. In Russia, they were extirpated in wide areas in the 1930s. The last boar in Egypt reportedly died on 20 December 1912 in the Giza Zoo, with wild populations having disappeared around 1894–1902. Prince Kamal el Dine Hussein attempted to repopulate Wadi El Natrun with boars of Hungarian stock, but they were quickly exterminated by poachers. A revival of boar populations began in the middle of the 20th century. By 1950 wild boar had once again reached their original northern boundary in many parts of their Asiatic range. By 1960, they reached Leningrad and Moscow, and by 1975 they were to be found in Archangelsk and Astrakhan. In the 1970s they again occurred in Denmark and Sweden, where captive animals escaped and now survive in the wild. In England, wild boar populations re-established themselves in the 1990s, after escaping from specialist farms that had imported European stock.</p>\\n<p><em>Status in Britain</em><br />\\n\\t\\tWild boars were apparently already becoming rare by the 11th century since a 1087 forestry law enacted by William the Conqueror punishes through blinding the unlawful killing of a boar. Charles I attempted to reintroduce the species into the New Forest, though this population was exterminated during the Civil War. Between their medieval extinction and the 1980s, when wild boar farming began, only a handful of captive wild boar, imported from the continent, were present in Britain. Occasional escapes of wild boar from wildlife parks have occurred as early as the 1970s, but since the early 1990s significant populations have re-established themselves after escapes from farms, the number of which has increased as the demand for meat from the species has grown. A 1998 MAFF (now DEFRA) study on wild boar living wild in Britain confirmed the presence of two populations of wild boar living in Britain; one in Kent/East Sussex and another in Dorset. Another DEFRA report, in February 2008, confirmed the existence of these two sites as \'established breeding areas\' and identified a third in Gloucestershire/Herefordshire; in the Forest of Dean/Ross on Wye area. A \'new breeding population\' was also identified in Devon. There is another significant population in Dumfries and Galloway. Populations estimates were as follows:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n\\t\\t\\tThe largest population, in Kent/East Sussex, was then estimated at approximately 200 animals in the core distribution area.</li>\\n<li>\\n\\t\\t\\tThe second largest, in Gloucestershire/Herefordshire, was first estimated to be in excess of 100 animals. Legally classified as dangerous wild animals, the group is known to be feral descendants of domestic (Tamworth) pigs abandoned nearby. Their numbers grew by 2016 to at least 1500 and the Forestry Commission planned to reduce the total to a manageable 400. \\"Adult males can reach twenty stone (125 kg), run at thirty miles an hour, and can jump or barge through all but the strongest fences. Also, they are not afraid of humans, so (unlike deer) you can\'t just shoo them out of your garden.\\"</li>\\n<li>\\n\\t\\t\\tThe smallest, in west Dorset, was estimated to be fewer than 50 animals.</li>\\n<li>\\n\\t\\t\\tSince winter 2005/6 significant escapes/releases have also resulted in animals colonizing areas around the fringes of Dartmoor, in Devon. These are considered as an additional single \'new breeding population\' and currently estimated to be up to 100 animals.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Population estimates for the Forest of Dean are disputed as at the time that the DEFRA population estimate was 100, a photo of a boar sounder in the forest near Staunton with over 33 animals visible was published, and at about the same time over 30 boar were seen in a field near the original escape location of Weston under Penyard many miles away. In early 2010 the Forestry Commission embarked on a cull, with the aim of reducing the boar population from an estimated 150 animals to 100. By August it was stated that efforts were being made to reduce the population from 200 to 90, but that only 25 had been killed.The failure to meet cull targets was confirmed in February 2011. Wild boars have crossed the River Wye into Monmouthshire, Wales. Iolo Williams, the BBC Wales wildlife expert, attempted to film Welsh boar in late 2012. Many other sightings, across the UK, have also been reported. The effects of wild boar on the UK\'s woodlands were discussed with Ralph Harmer of the Forestry Commission on the BBC Radio\'s Farming Today radio programme in 2011. The programme prompted activist writer George Monbiot to propose a thorough population study, followed by the introduction of permit-controlled culling.</p>\\n<p><em>Introduction to North America</em><br />\\n\\t\\tWild boars are an invasive species in the Americas, and cause problems including outcompeting native species for food, destroying the nests of ground-nesting species, killing fawns and young domestic livestock, destroying agricultural crops, eating tree seeds and seedlings, destroying native vegetation and wetlands through wallowing, damaging water quality, coming into violent conflict with humans and pets, and carrying pig and human diseases including brucellosis, trichinosis, and pseudorabies. In some jurisdictions, it is illegal to import, breed, release, possess, sell, distribute, trade, transport, hunt, or trap Eurasian boars. Hunting and trapping is done systematically, to increase the chance of eradication and to remove the incentive to illegally release boars, which have mostly been spread deliberately by sport hunters.</p>\\n<p>History<br />\\n\\t\\tWhile domestic pigs, both captive and feral (popularly termed \\"razorbacks\\"), have been in North America since the earliest days of European colonization, pure wild boars were not introduced into the New World until the 19th century. The suids were released into the wild by wealthy landowners as big game animals. The initial introductions took place in fenced enclosures, though several escapes occurred, with the escapees sometimes intermixing with already established feral pig populations. The first of these introductions occurred in New Hampshire in 1890. Thirteen wild boars from Germany were purchased by Austin Corbin from Carl Hagenbeck, and released into a 9,500-hectare game preserve in Sullivan County. Several of these boars escaped, though they were quickly hunted down by locals. Two further introductions were made from the original stocking, with several escapes taking place due to breaches in the game preserve\'s fencing. These escapees have ranged widely, with some specimens having been observed crossing into Vermont. In 1902, 15–20 wild boar from Germany were released into a 3,200-hectare estate in Hamilton County, New York. Several specimens escaped six years later, dispersing into the William C. Whitney Wilderness Area, with their descendants surviving for at least 20 years. The most extensive boar introduction in the US took place in western North Carolina in 1912, when 13 boars of undetermined European origin were released into two fenced enclosures in a game preserve in Hooper Bald, Graham County. Most of the specimens remained in the preserve for the next decade, until a large-scale hunt caused the remaining animals to break through their confines and escape. Some of the boars migrated to Tennessee, where they intermixed with both free-ranging and feral pigs in the area. In 1924, a dozen Hooper Bald wild pigs were shipped to California and released in a property between Carmel Valley and the Los Padres National Forest. These hybrid boar were later used as breeding stock on various private and public lands throughout the state, as well as in other states like Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, West Virginia and Mississippi. Several wild boars from Leon Springs and the San Antonio, Saint Louis and San Diego Zoos were released in the Powder Horn Ranch in Calhoun County, Texas, in 1939. These specimens escaped and established themselves in surrounding ranchlands and coastal areas, with some crossing the Espiritu Santo Bay and colonizing Matagorda Island. Descendants of the Powder Horn Ranch boars were later released onto San José Island and the coast of Chalmette, Louisiana. Wild boar of unknown origin were stocked in a ranch in the Edwards Plateau in the 1940s, only to escape during a storm and hybridize with local feral pig populations, later spreading into neighboring counties. Starting in the mid-80s, several boars purchased from the San Diego Zoo and Tierpark Berlin were released into the United States. A decade later, more specimens from farms in Canada and Białowieża Forest was let loose. In recent years, wild pig populations have been reported in 44 states within the US, most of which are likely wild boar–feral hog hybrids. Pure wild boar populations may still be present, but are extremely localized.</p>\\n<p><u>Diseases and parasites</u><br />\\n\\t\\tWild boars are known to host at least 20 different parasitic worm species, with maximum infections occurring in summer. Young animals are vulnerable to helminths like Metastrongylus, which are consumed by boars through earthworms, and cause death by parasitising the lungs. Wild boar also carry parasites known to infect humans, including Gastrodiscoides, Trichinella spiralis, Taenia solium, and Balantidium coli. Wild boar in southern regions are frequently infested with ticks (Dermacentor, Rhipicephalus, and Hyalomma) and hog lice. The species also suffers from blood-sucking flies, which it escapes by bathing frequently or hiding in dense shrubs. Swine plague spreads very quickly in wild boar, with epizootics being recorded in Germany, Poland, Hungary, Belarus, the Caucasus, the Far East, Kazakhstan, and other regions. Foot-and-mouth disease can also take on epidemic proportions in boar populations. The species occasionally, but rarely contracts Pasteurellosis, hemorrhagic septicemia, tularemia and anthrax. Wild boar may on occasion contract swine erysipelas through rodents or hog lice and ticks.</p>\\n<p><u>Relationships with humans</u><br />\\n\\t\\tIn culture The wild boar features prominently in the cultures of Indo-European people, many of which saw the animal as embodying warrior virtues. Cultures throughout Europe and Asia Minor saw the killing of a boar as proof of one\'s valor and strength. Neolithic hunter gatherers depicted reliefs of ferocious wild boars on their temple pillars at Göbekli Tepe some 11,600 years ago. Virtually all heroes in Greek mythology fight or kill a boar at one point. The demigod Herakles\' third labour involves the capture of the Erymanthian Boar, Theseus slays the wild sow Phaea, and a disguised Odysseus is recognised by his handmaiden Eurycleia by the scars inflicted on him by a boar during a hunt in his youth. To the mythical Hyperboreans, the boar represented spiritual authority. Several Greek myths use the boar as a symbol of darkness, death, and winter. One example is the story of the youthful Adonis, who is killed by a boar and is permitted by Zeus to depart from Hades only during the spring and summer period. This theme also occurs in Irish and Egyptian mythology, where the animal is explicitly linked to the month of October, therefore autumn. This association likely arose from aspects of the boar\'s actual nature. Its dark colour was linked to the night, while its solitary habits, proclivity to consume crops and nocturnal nature were associated with evil. The foundation myth of Ephesus has the city being built over the site where prince Androklos of Athens killed a boar. Boars were frequently depicted on Greek funerary monuments alongside lions, representing gallant losers who have finally met their match, as opposed to victorious hunters as lions are. The theme of the doomed, yet valorous boar warrior also occurred in Hittite culture, where it was traditional to sacrifice a boar alongside a dog and a prisoner of war after a military defeat. The boar as a warrior also appears in Scandinavian, Germanic and Anglo-Saxon culture, with its image having been frequently engraved on helmets, shields, and swords. According to Tacitus, the Baltic Aesti featured boars on their helmets, and may have also worn boar masks (see for example the Guilden Morden boar). The boar and pig were held in particularly high esteem by the Celts, who considered them to be their most important sacred animal. Some Celtic deities linked to boars include Moccus and Veteris. It has been suggested that some early myths surrounding the Welsh hero Culhwch involved the character being the son of a boar god. Nevertheless, the importance of the boar as a culinary item among Celtic tribes may have been exaggerated in popular culture by the Asterix series, as wild boar bones are rare among Celtic archaeological sites, and the few that occur show no signs of butchery, having probably been used in sacrificial rituals. The boar also appears in Vedic mythology. A story present in the Brāhmaṇas has Indra slaying an avaricious boar, who has stolen the treasure of the asuras, then giving its carcass to Vishnu, who offered it as a sacrifice to the gods. In the story\'s retelling in the Charaka Samhita, the boar is described as a form of Prajāpti, and is credited with having raised the earth from the primeval waters. In the Rāmāyaṇa and the Purāṇas, the same boar is portrayed as an avatar of Vishnu. In Japanese culture, the boar is widely seen as a fearsome and reckless animal, to the point that several words and expressions in Japanese referring to recklessness include references to boars. The boar is the last animal of the oriental zodiac, with people born during the year of the Pig being said to embody the boar-like traits of determination and impetuosity. Among Japanese hunters, the boar\'s courage and defiance is a source of admiration, and it is not uncommon for hunters and mountain people to name their sons after the animal inoshishi (猪). Boars are also seen as symbols of fertility and prosperity; in some regions, it is thought that boars are drawn to fields owned by families including pregnant women, and hunters with pregnant wives are thought to have greater chances of success when boar hunting. The animal\'s link to prosperity was illustrated by its inclusion on the ¥10 note during the Meiji period, and it was once believed that a man could become wealthy by keeping a clump of boar hair in his wallet. In the folklore of the Mongol Altai Uriankhai tribe, the wild boar was associated with the watery underworld, as it was thought that the spirits of the dead entered the animal\'s head, to be ultimately transported to the water. Prior to the conversion to Islam, the Kyrgyz people believed that they were descended from boars, and thus did not eat pork. In Buryat mythology, the forefathers of the Buryats descended from heaven and were nourished by a boar. In China, the boar is the emblem of the Miao people. The boar (sanglier) is frequently displayed in English, Scottish and Welsh heraldry. As with the lion, the boar is often shown as armed and langued. As with the bear, Scottish and Welsh heraldry displays the boar\'s head with the neck cropped, unlike the English version, which retains the neck. The white boar served as the badge of King Richard III of England, who distributed it among his northern retainers during his tenure as Duke of Gloucester.</p>\\n<p><em>As a game animal and food source</em><br />\\n\\t\\tHumans have been hunting boar for millennia, with the earliest artistic depictions of such activities dating back to the Upper Paleolithic. The animal was seen as a source of food among the Ancient Greeks, as well as a sporting challenge and source of epic narratives. The Romans inherited this tradition, with one of its first practitioners being Scipio Aemilianus. Boar hunting became particularly popular among the young nobility during the 3rd century BC as preparation for manhood and battle. A typical Roman boar hunting tactic involved surrounding a given area with large nets, then flushing the boar with dogs and immobilizing it with smaller nets. The animal would then be dispatched with a venabulum, a short spear with a crossguard at the base of the blade. More than their Greek predecessors, the Romans extensively took inspiration from boar hunting in their art and sculpture. With the ascension of Constantine the Great, boar hunting took on Christian allegorical themes, with the animal being portrayed as a \\"black beast\\" analogous to the dragon of Saint George. Boar hunting continued after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, though the Germanic tribes considered the red deer to be a more noble and worthy quarry. The post-Roman nobility hunted boar as their predecessors did, but primarily as training for battle rather than sport. It was not uncommon for medieval hunters to deliberately hunt boars during the breeding season when the animals were more aggressive. During the Renaissance, when deforestation and the introduction of firearms reduced boar numbers, boarhunting became the sole prerogative of the nobility, one of many charges brought up against the rich during the German Peasants\' War and the French Revolution. During the mid-20th century, 7,000–8,000 boars were caught in the Caucasus, 6,000–7,000 in Kazakhstan, and about 5,000 in Central Asia during the Soviet period, primarily through use of dogs and beats. In Nepal, farmers and poachers eliminate boars by baiting balls of wheat flour containing explosives with kerosene oil, with the animals\' chewing motions triggering the devices. Wild boar can thrive in captivity, though piglets grow slowly and poorly without their mothers. Products derived from wild boar include meat, hide and bristles. Apicius devotes a whole chapter to the cooking of boar meat, providing ten recipes involving roasting, boiling and what sauces to use. The Romans usually served boar meat with garum. Boar\'s head was the centrepiece of most medieval Christmas celebrations among the nobility. Although growing in popularity as a captive-bred source of food, the wild boar takes longer to mature than most domestic pigs, and is usually smaller and produces less meat. Nevertheless, wild boar meat is leaner and healthier than pork, being of higher nutritional value and having a much higher concentration of essential amino acids. Most meat-dressing organizations agree that a boar carcass should yield 50 kg (110 lb) of meat on average. Large specimens can yield 15–20 kg (33–44 lb) of fat, with some giants yielding 30 kg (66 lb) or more. A boar hide can measure 300 dm2, and can yield 350–1000 grams of bristle and 400 grams of underwool.</p>\\n<p><em>Crop and garbage raiding</em><br />\\n\\t\\tBoars can be damaging to agriculture. Populations living on the outskirts of towns or farms can dig up potatoes and damage melons, watermelons and maize. They generally only encroach upon farms when natural food is scarce. In the Belovezh forest for example, 34–47% of the local boar population will enter fields in years of moderate availability of natural foods. While the role of boars in damaging crops is often exaggerated, cases are known of boar depredations causing famines, as was the case in Hachinohe, Japan in 1749, where 3,000 people died of what became known as the \'wild boar famine\'. Still, within Japanese culture, the boar\'s status as vermin is expressed through its title as \\"king of pests\\" and the popular saying (addressed to young men in rural areas) \\"When you get married, choose a place with no wild boar.\\" In Central Europe, farmers typically repel boars through distraction or fright, while in Kazakhstan it is usual to employ guard dogs in plantations. Although large boar populations can play an important role in limiting forest growth, they are also useful in keeping pest populations such as June bugs under control. The growth of urban areas and the corresponding decline in natural boar habitats has led to some sounders entering human habitations in search of food. As in natural conditions, sounders in peri-urban areas are matriarchal, though males tend to be much less represented, and adults of both sexes can be up to 35% heavier than their forest-dwelling counterparts. As of 2010, at least 44 cities in 15 countries have experienced problems of some kind relating to the presence of habituated wild boar.</p>\\n<p><em>Attacks on humans</em><br />\\n\\t\\tActual attacks on humans are rare, but can be serious, resulting in multiple penetrating injuries to the lower part of the body. They generally occur during the boars\' rutting season from November to January, in agricultural areas bordering forests or on paths leading through forests. The animal typically attacks by charging and pointing its tusks towards the intended victim, with most injuries occurring on the thigh region. Once the initial attack is over, the boar steps back, takes position and attacks again if the victim is still moving, only ending once the victim is completely incapacitated. Boar attacks on humans have been documented since the Stone Age, with one of the oldest depictions being a cave painting in Bhimbetaka, India. The Romans and Ancient Greeks wrote of these attacks (Odysseus was wounded by a boar, and Adonis was killed by one). A 2012 study compiling recorded attacks from 1825–2012 found accounts of 665 human victims of both wild boars and feral pigs, with the majority (19%) of attacks in the animal\'s native range occurring in India. Most of the attacks occurred in rural areas during the winter months in non-hunting contexts and were committed by solitary males.</p>\\n</div>\\n",

Adult males have a red cap going from the bill to the nape; females have a red patch on the nape and another above the bill. The reddish tinge on the belly that gives the bird its name is difficult to see in field identification. They are 22.85 to 26.7 cm (9.00 to 10.51 in) long, and have a wingspan of 38 to 46 cm (15 to 18 in).</p>\\r\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Vocalizations</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tRed-bellied woodpeckers are noisy birds, and have many varied calls. Calls have been described as sounding like churr-churr-churr or thrraa-thrraa-thrraa with an alternating br-r-r-r-t sound. Males tend to call and drum more frequently than females, but both sexes call. Often, these woodpeckers \\"drum\\" to attract mates. They tap on aluminum roofs, metal guttering, hollow trees and even transformer boxes, in urban environments, to communicate with potential partners. Babies have a high-pitched begging call of pree-pree-pree. They will continue to give a begging call whenever they see their parents for a while after fledging.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">These birds mainly search out arthropods on tree trunks. They may also catch insects in flight. They are omnivores, eating insects, fruits, nuts and seeds. Their breeding habitat is usually deciduous forests. They nest in the decayed cavities of dead trees, old stumps, or in live trees that have softer wood such as elms, maples, or willows; both sexes assist in digging nesting cavities. Areas around nest sites are marked with drilling holes to warn others away.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Though the species is not globally threatened, it depends on large trees for nesting. In areas that are extensively deforested, the birds will sometimes utilize gardens, but for the most part simply will not be present in any numbers.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Foraging</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tAs with all animals, foraging becomes an important role in an animal’s ability to survive and reproduce. The red-bellied woodpecker expresses foraging behavior by catching or storing food.[5] The woodpecker uses its bill for foraging as a chisel drilling into bark or probing cracks on trunk of trees. In this manner, the red-bellied woodpecker is able to pull out beetles and other insects from the tree with the help of its long tongue. This behavior is also seen for storing food from other animals by hiding food behind bark or deep in cracks of a tree. According to studies from Williams 1975, Breitwisch 1977, and Batzil 1979, the red-bellied woodpecker spent 20% to 69% foraging on dead or decaying trees. In addition, Williams 1975, Breitwisch 1977, and Batzil 1979 observed red-bellied woodpecker 80% gleaning and probing and 10% excavating on trees in South Florida pine habitat. The red-bellied woodpecker relies on snags or dying trees for foraging and nesting. The red-bellied woodpecker is a major predator of the invasive emerald ash borer in the U.S. Midwest, removing up to 85 percent of borer larvae in single infested ash tree.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Predation</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tPredators of adult red-bellied woodpeckers include birds of prey such as sharp-shinned hawks and Cooper\'s hawks, black rat snakes and house cats. Known predators of nestlings and eggs include red-headed woodpeckers, owls, pileated woodpeckers, gray rat snakes and black rat snakes. When approached by a predator, red-bellied woodpeckers either hide from the predator, or harass it with alarm calls. They defend their nests and young aggressively, and may directly attack predators that come near the nest.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Breeding</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tIn early May, the red-bellied woodpeckers begin breeding activities by drumming patterns; such as, slow taps followed by short rapid drumming. Woodpeckers depend on dead and drying wood for nesting purposes. The male red-bellied woodpecker takes the initiative in locating a nest hole. He will then seek approval from his female mate by mutual tapping. The red-bellied woodpecker excavates holes in trees for nesting and roosting. By excavating cavities, they play an important role in the forest communities for other species as well. For example, species such as squirrels and bats use these cavities as shelter. The female red-bellied woodpecker accepts the nesting hole by completing the excavation and entering the nest hole.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Researchers have documented that red-bellied woodpeckers have the tendency to nest in clear areas with only few trees. Studies have indicated that close canopy areas does not impact the bird\'s nesting behavior; however, further studies are needed and are in progress. Red-bellied woodpeckers are territorial during the nesting season and they breed once per year. A pair-breeding woodpecker begins nesting in April or May holding a year-round territories and showing high site fidelity.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Red-bellied woodpeckers depend on dead trees for nesting. Recent studies have shown that these woodpeckers experienced low breeding due to cutting sites of dead trees; however, predators are still of main concern. The juvenile red-bellied woodpecker are ready to fledge its nest at 24 to 26 days of age. Natal dispersal has been observed on juvenile red-bellied woodpeckers. The juvenile red-bellied woodpecker remains approximately 27 weeks in its natal area after fledging. In some cases, the woodpecker may return to its natal area for breeding depending on predation levels and food resources.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Courtship</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tIt has been noted that vocal signals in red-bellied woodpeckers is used to attract and communicate with potential mates. A low \\"grr, grr\\" sound is observed in a pair of woodpeckers from the start of courtship until the end of the breeding season. In an intraspecific conflict, the red-bellied woodpeckers usually make a loud \\"chee-wuck, chee-wuck, chee-wuck\\" sound.

            \'safe_value\' => "<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Adults are mainly light gray on the face and underparts; they have black and white barred patterns on their back, wings and tail. Adult males have a red cap going from the bill to the nape; females have a red patch on the nape and another above the bill. The reddish tinge on the belly that gives the bird its name is difficult to see in field identification. They are 22.85 to 26.7 cm (9.00 to 10.51 in) long, and have a wingspan of 38 to 46 cm (15 to 18 in).</p>\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Vocalizations</strong><br />\\n\\t\\tRed-bellied woodpeckers are noisy birds, and have many varied calls. Calls have been described as sounding like churr-churr-churr or thrraa-thrraa-thrraa with an alternating br-r-r-r-t sound. Males tend to call and drum more frequently than females, but both sexes call. Often, these woodpeckers \\"drum\\" to attract mates. They tap on aluminum roofs, metal guttering, hollow trees and even transformer boxes, in urban environments, to communicate with potential partners. Babies have a high-pitched begging call of pree-pree-pree. They will continue to give a begging call whenever they see their parents for a while after fledging.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">These birds mainly search out arthropods on tree trunks. They may also catch insects in flight. They are omnivores, eating insects, fruits, nuts and seeds. Their breeding habitat is usually deciduous forests. They nest in the decayed cavities of dead trees, old stumps, or in live trees that have softer wood such as elms, maples, or willows; both sexes assist in digging nesting cavities. Areas around nest sites are marked with drilling holes to warn others away.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Though the species is not globally threatened, it depends on large trees for nesting. In areas that are extensively deforested, the birds will sometimes utilize gardens, but for the most part simply will not be present in any numbers.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Foraging</strong><br />\\n\\t\\tAs with all animals, foraging becomes an important role in an animal’s ability to survive and reproduce. The red-bellied woodpecker expresses foraging behavior by catching or storing food.[5] The woodpecker uses its bill for foraging as a chisel drilling into bark or probing cracks on trunk of trees. In this manner, the red-bellied woodpecker is able to pull out beetles and other insects from the tree with the help of its long tongue. This behavior is also seen for storing food from other animals by hiding food behind bark or deep in cracks of a tree. According to studies from Williams 1975, Breitwisch 1977, and Batzil 1979, the red-bellied woodpecker spent 20% to 69% foraging on dead or decaying trees. In addition, Williams 1975, Breitwisch 1977, and Batzil 1979 observed red-bellied woodpecker 80% gleaning and probing and 10% excavating on trees in South Florida pine habitat. The red-bellied woodpecker relies on snags or dying trees for foraging and nesting. The red-bellied woodpecker is a major predator of the invasive emerald ash borer in the U.S. Midwest, removing up to 85 percent of borer larvae in single infested ash tree.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Predation</strong><br />\\n\\t\\tPredators of adult red-bellied woodpeckers include birds of prey such as sharp-shinned hawks and Cooper\'s hawks, black rat snakes and house cats. Known predators of nestlings and eggs include red-headed woodpeckers, owls, pileated woodpeckers, gray rat snakes and black rat snakes. When approached by a predator, red-bellied woodpeckers either hide from the predator, or harass it with alarm calls. They defend their nests and young aggressively, and may directly attack predators that come near the nest.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Breeding</strong><br />\\n\\t\\tIn early May, the red-bellied woodpeckers begin breeding activities by drumming patterns; such as, slow taps followed by short rapid drumming. Woodpeckers depend on dead and drying wood for nesting purposes. The male red-bellied woodpecker takes the initiative in locating a nest hole. He will then seek approval from his female mate by mutual tapping. The red-bellied woodpecker excavates holes in trees for nesting and roosting. By excavating cavities, they play an important role in the forest communities for other species as well. For example, species such as squirrels and bats use these cavities as shelter. The female red-bellied woodpecker accepts the nesting hole by completing the excavation and entering the nest hole.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Researchers have documented that red-bellied woodpeckers have the tendency to nest in clear areas with only few trees. Studies have indicated that close canopy areas does not impact the bird\'s nesting behavior; however, further studies are needed and are in progress. Red-bellied woodpeckers are territorial during the nesting season and they breed once per year. A pair-breeding woodpecker begins nesting in April or May holding a year-round territories and showing high site fidelity.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Red-bellied woodpeckers depend on dead trees for nesting. Recent studies have shown that these woodpeckers experienced low breeding due to cutting sites of dead trees; however, predators are still of main concern. The juvenile red-bellied woodpecker are ready to fledge its nest at 24 to 26 days of age. Natal dispersal has been observed on juvenile red-bellied woodpeckers. The juvenile red-bellied woodpecker remains approximately 27 weeks in its natal area after fledging. In some cases, the woodpecker may return to its natal area for breeding depending on predation levels and food resources.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Courtship</strong><br />\\n\\t\\tIt has been noted that vocal signals in red-bellied woodpeckers is used to attract and communicate with potential mates. A low \\"grr, grr\\" sound is observed in a pair of woodpeckers from the start of courtship until the end of the breeding season. In an intraspecific conflict, the red-bellied woodpeckers usually make a loud \\"chee-wuck, chee-wuck, chee-wuck\\" sound. As indicated by Kilham 1983, the red-bellied woodpecker drums with its bill during conflict situation and taps to maintain pair bonding. An example of a conflict event between red-bellied woodpeckers would be competing for the same mate. Nevertheless, the red-bellied woodpeckers are known to be in monogamous relationships.</p>\\n</div>\\n<hr />\\n<p>References<br />\\n\\tPhotographed: Manatee Sanctuary Park - Cape Canaveral, Florida, May 2016<br />\\n\\t<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-bellied_woodpecker\\">Wikipedia</a></p>\\n",

These substitutes are all butterflyfishes of the genus Heniochus, and include the pennant coralfish, H. acuminatus; threeband pennantfish, H. chrysostomus; and the false Moorish idol, H. diphreutes.[citation needed] Moorish idols typically are very picky eaters. They will either eat nothing (common) and perish or eat everything (uncommon).</p>\\n<p><u>Synonyms </u><br />\\n\\tZanclus cornutus (Linnaeus, 1758) accepted senior, new combination</p>\\n<p>Chaetodon cornutus Linnaeus, 1758 synonym, original</p>\\n<p>Chaetodon canescens Linnaeus, 1758 junior synonym, original</p>\\n<p>Zanclus canescens (Linnaeus, 1758) junior synonym, new combination</p>\\n<p><u>Cultural references</u></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n\\t\\tIn the 2003 Pixar film Finding Nemo, a Moorish idol named Gill (voiced by Willem Dafoe) was one of Nemo\'s tank-mates. Gill was depicted having a very strong desire for freedom outside of the aquarium and was constantly scheming to achieve this, possibly alluding to the difficulty of keeping real-life Moorish idols in captivity. Gill and the other members of the Tank Gang appeared in the sequel, Finding Dory as an Easter egg at the end of the credits.</li>\\n<li>\\n\\t\\tMoorish idols have long been among the most recognizable of coral reef fauna.

The next most closely related species, however, is B. terricola, which is very similar to B. affinis in terms of bodily pheromones. This similarity allows members of B. affinis to successfully dominate B. terricola workers after usurping their nests. B. affinis is in the company of nearly 250 other species of bumblebee worldwide that fall within the genus of Bombus, although only 50 are native to parts of the US and Canada. Unlike other members of the family apidae, B. affinis workers and queens are characterized by different color patterns, which allow observers to tell them apart.</p>\\r\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Description and identification</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t<em>Morphology</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThere are large differences in morphology between both queens and workers, and males and females. Queens are approximately 20–22 millimetres (0.79–0.87 in) in length and 9–11 millimetres (0.35–0.43 in) in width, which is larger than workers that are typically about 10–16 millimetres (0.39–0.63 in) in length and 6–9 millimetres (0.24–0.35 in) in width. Both queens and workers have black hair that covers their head, much of their legs, and the bottom of their abdomens. They also both have completely yellow hair on the majority of their abdomen, except for a small section near the area closest to the rear end of the bee. Workers have a slight mixing of yellow and black hairs near the base of the wings, which forms a discernible \\"v\\" shape, as well as a rust colored patch of hair on the middle portion of the abdomen. Thus, while workers and queens share similarities in certain aspects of coloration, there are also differences in terms of body size and the presence or absence of rust colored patch of hair. Regardless of the caste within the colony, all members of B. affinis have significantly shorter tongues than any other species of bumblebee. Because of its body size and fury appearance, however, this bee is often confused with other species of bumblebee, such as B. citrinus, B. griseocollis, B. perplexus, and B. vagans.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Furthermore, male and female workers of B. affinis also differ in terms of their appearance and body size. Male workers are typically slightly larger than females (13–17.5 millimetres (0.51–0.69 in) in length), and have a few off-white/pale hairs that are present on top of their head. They also have black hair which will sometimes streak across the top of the abdomen (which is typically yellow). Finally, males can even have pale yellow hair on the abdomen, as opposed to the normal shade of yellow that is observed in females and queens.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Nests</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tMembers of B. affinis are known to build their nests underground in locations such as ditches on the side of the road, wetlands, and fields. However, there are instances where nests are constructed above ground in chunks of grass and dirt, which can be limited by the availability of open grasslands. An interesting fact about the B. affinis nest is that a nest was once found inside an armchair that was abandoned outside. When nests are constructed underground though, they are typically located 16–18 inches (410–460 mm) below the surface, and are composed of soft dirt.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tB. affinis requires three different types of habitats (each for foraging, nesting, and hibernating) which are geographically close to one another; making this species particularly vulnerable to extinction. As previously mentioned, this species is commonly found in the eastern regions of the United States and Southern areas of Canada, including Ontario. It requires a temperate climate, and can even withstand cold temperatures that most species of bumblebees cannot. In addition, B. affinis has been found at elevations as high as 1600m. B. affinis is known to visit a number of sites for foraging, including sand dunes, farmland, and marshes, and wooded areas. Members will actively forage between the months of April and October, and thus, require flowers to bloom for a lengthy amount of time. Furthermore, their nesting habitat is often found underground. B. affinis nests are strikingly similar to other species of bees, which makes them difficult to locate. However, queen and workers will work together to make individual cells and honey pots out of wax stores. In terms of their hibernating habitat, little information is known. It is not thought that B. affinis queens will overwinter, however, they most likely will live underground or burrow into rotting logs during the winter time to survive. While B. affinis\' habitat used to be highly prevalent, there has been a large decline in recent years, possibly due to increased land development and agricultural use.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Until the 1980s, it was one of the most common species of bumblebee in southern Ontario. Since then, the species has had a drastic decline in number and is now difficult to find in its normal range. The only locality within Ontario where the rusty-patched bumblebee has been seen in the last five years is Pinery Provincial Park (Lambton County), despite widespread surveys in Ontario. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources has begun a recovery project aimed at protecting the species and critical habitats centered in Pinery Provincial Park. These threats have been proposed as the cause of population decline: pathogen spillover from other species, pesticide use, and habitat fragmentation and loss. Surveys from 2001–2008 have located Bombus affinis populations only in Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, and southern Ontario.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Colony cycle</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t<em>Colony initiation and growth</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tNew colonies are started by B. affinis in the spring and decline in the fall. Members of this species will actually emerge before most other species of Bombus, and will continue foraging after other species have begun hibernating. Solitary queens will be the first to emerge and begin searching for a colony, while also collecting nectar and pollen to feed her future brood. The queen uses sperm she has saved from her mating activities of the previous fall to fertilize her eggs. Eggs will hatch about four days after fertilization, but will take up to 5 weeks to become completely developed adults depending on temperature and food availability. In the first few weeks after laying her brood, the queen is solely responsible for feeding her young.However, shortly afterwards, her female worker offspring will begin collecting food for the colony in preparation for more offspring. Once the workers are able to become the primary caretakers of the nest, the queen can focus on laying more eggs. At this point (which is about halfway through the summer) the number of workers will reach an optimal number and the queen will begin producing males and potential queens. Colony sizes can range anywhere from 50 to approximately 400 individuals, although colonies that are raised in captivity are known to get much larger, having as many members as 2100.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Colony decline</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tDuring this half-way point in the summer, any members with reproductive potential will leave the nest and begin mating. The number of potential queens that can be produced is heavily reliant on the amount of nectar and pollen that can gathered during this time. Thus, a shortage of food may result in lesser queen production, and vice versa. But because solitary queens are the only members of the B. affinis that can initiate new colonies, the success of future colonies is dependent on queen production. Furthermore, after mating, new queens will rest and enter into diapause, or hibernation for the winter. Male members and workers will decline as the weather gets colder, and will eventually die when winter comes. Thus, colonies live for about 4–5 months depending on the environmental conditions. It is important to note that it is common for queens to die at different times throughout colony production, which can often lead to orphaned colonies. Queens typically live for about 77 days on average, from the time the colony is created until the time that the queen dies.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Reproductive suppression</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tSimilar to other social insects, egg laying by B. affinis workers is suppressed by the presence of a dominant queen that is capable of reproducing. The queen\'s position as a dominant member or leader of the colony is made known through both pheromones and behavioral patterns. However, it is strictly the presence of specific pheromones that suppress gonadotropic hormones in B. affinis workers, leading to suppressed reproductive potential. Recent studies have revealed that there is variability in dominance signals both between certain species, and also between subspecies or subgenera. For example, in B. terrestris colonies, it is presence or absence of abdominal glands rather than pheromones that dictates the dominance of the queen. In the absence of a fecund queen, aggression and violence between workers increases quickly. In addition, ovarian weight is significantly lower in colonies where the queen is present than when she is removed.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">It was previously thought that Bombus bohemicus (an obligate brood parasite of B. affinis) also played a role in suppressing ovarian development in B. affinis, however, it has recently been discovered that this is not the case. Members of the Psithyrus genus will often maul other members of the host colony, which indirectly decreases the number of eggs laid in the host colony. B. bohemicus does not demonstrate this behavior, and actually has worse chances of survival in nests where there is not a dominant queen present, due to increased aggression by B. affinis members. However, it is important to note that while ovarian development is not impacted by the presence of B. bohemicus, overall reproductive success is decreased due to consumption of the host eggs and larval ejection.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Kin selection</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t<em>Genetic relatedness</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tGenetic relatedness within the B. affinis species varies depending on the relationship. Because members are haplodiploid making males haploid and females diploid, so genetic relatedness is asymmetrical, causing workers to be more closely related to their sisters than their brothers. B. affinis workers share a correlation coefficient (or variable indicating the strength of the relatedness/ degree of relatedness) of r = 0.75 with full sisters but only r = 0.25 for full brothers. In addition, workers are also much more closely related to their sons than their own brothers, and even more so than their nephews. The r value is likely greater than 0.5 for sons. While it is advantageous for ratio of males to queens to be 1:1 normally, this asymmetry in genetic relatedness results in much conflict between the queen and the workers. Thus, all members who are workers should demonstrate favor for a predominantly female population (if the queen is the major egg layer in the colony).</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Worker/queen conflict</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tDifferences in genetic relatedness can result in conflict between the B. affinis queen and workers. This conflict can manifest itself in one of two ways - either through a skewed sex ratio with the absence of any physical aggression, or through direct contact in which one member will act violently towards another member to inhibit reproductive success. Should aggression manifest itself as skewed sex ratios, the ratio of male to female offspring varies depending on the contribution from queens and workers. For example, if there is no worker contribution, the ratio will be 1:3 (males to females), however, if contribution is solely from workers, then the ratio be far closer to 1:1. However, should the aggression manifest itself as violent behaviors, they will often be directed toward a member\'s brood, through actions such as larval ejection. This larval ejection is often associated with the degradation of group cohesion, and typically occurs at a late stage in colony development. It can also be the result of workers attempt to lay their own eggs, independently of the queen.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Interaction with other species</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t<em>Parasites</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tB. affinis is parasitized most extensively by a separate species of bee, Bombus bohemicus, which is an obligate brood parasite. B. bohemicus will end hibernation shortly after B. affinis, and search for their established nests, however, the exact mechanism is unknown. It is thought that female members of B. bohemicus are able to locate the host nests by identifying the odor from a distance—without ever having physical contact with the nest or regions that were utilized by workers. By flying low to the ground and searching carefully (even by looking near leaves and debris), B. bohemicus may first locate the entrance of a B. affinis nest, and then verify their findings via odor identification. After invading the nest, however, the B. bohemicus will live alongside the queen and the workers, and will also attempt to rear their own brood (who must be raised with host workers\' help). Because larger nests tend to have more workers defending the nest, B. bohemicus often invades smaller nests, which forces it to occupy smaller nests for larger periods of time B. bohemicus is uniquely found in the nests of B. affinis and B. terricola, where it is usually tolerated if unnoticed. However, B. affinis has been known to exhibit oophagy (or consumption of non-host eggs), larval ejection, and ejection of the parasite in response to parasite presence. Should B. bohemicus make a mistake in invading the nests of other species, they will be attacked by the queen, whose violent actions often end in their death.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Diet</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tB. affinis consumes the nectar and pollen of a variety of nototrobic plant species, including the Lobelia siphilitica, Linaria vulgaris, and Antirrhinum majus. Dicentra cucullaria, a type of flowering plant, is particularly dependent on members of the B. affinis for sexual reproduction. In fact, the flower structure and mechanism by which it is pollinated indicate that it is adapted for foragers such as B. affinis, which can separate the outer and inner petals of the flower. Members will then use their front legs to expose the stigma, stamen, and anthers. Shortly afterwards, they will sweep pollen in a forward stroke by utilizing their middle legs, before leaving the flower to return to the colony with the pollen. In this way, the D. cucullaria is pollinated as the bees move from plant to plant, and the B. affinis meets its dietary needs. This pollen foraging behavior is strikingly similar to bees of the genus Apis. Species of the Apis variety are lighter in weight though, making it slightly more difficult to gain access.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Disease</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tB. affinis is susceptible to a certain species of protozoa, known as Apicystis bombi. This pathogen impacts about 3% of all Bombus affinis, and is particularly prevalent in Ontario, Canada. A. bombi first infects the gut of its host, then spreads this infection to the rest of the body. While its transmission is not well understood, A. bombi causes multiple negative impacts, including increased death of worker bees, and the prevention of formation of new colonies. It also limits ovarian development of queens, and reduces their lifespans. Its thought that this disease was introduced to North America by commercial B. terrestris in the early in early 2005 or 2006 when members invaded northern Patagonia, Argentina from Europe. A. bombi rarely impacts bees occupying Europe (only about 6-8% show signs of infection), however, for European bees living in Patagonia, incidence of infection is closer to about 50% in certain species. Because of this, there is great concern by conservation experts that A. bombi may be detrimental to several bumblebee species, including B. affinis.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Importance in agriculture</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tB. affinis is important to the agricultural industry. It is known that members of this species pollinate up to 65 different species of plants, and is the primary pollinator of key dietary crops, such as cranberries, plums, apples, onions, and alfalfa. These crops are important for day-to-day consumption by humans, but are also vital to sustaining other birds and mammals that feed on their fruit. Plants pollinated by B. affinis (such as Aralia and Spiraea) are used medicinally by aboriginal peoples of Canada known as the First Nations. Thus, the recent decline of B. affinis could have far reaching affects on ecosystems, economic stability, and cultural traditions.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In 2008 it was reported that three recent events had led to the decline of B. affinis\' agricultural role: pathogen spillover, pesticide use, and habitat loss. Many bumblebees that are used in commercial businesses harbor harmful parasites that can impact nearby wild populations of B. affinis. This often has lethal effects, and has led to the decline of B. terricola and B. impatiens, the common eastern bumblebee, as well. Aside from pathogen spillover, however, novel pesticides also impact populations of B. affinis. Neonicotinoids in particular are pesticides that are toxic to bees, however, they are commonly used for pest control on crops and turf. Because B. affinis nests are built underground, they are uniquely susceptible to this pesticide\'s use on turf. Lastly, increases in urbanization and industrialization have meant the loss of native habitats. While other species such as B. bimaculatus, the two-spotted bumble bee, have adapted well to urban environments, B. affinis has not. It is not known, however, whether or not the reduction of native food plants in particular has impacted B. affinis.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Nectar robbing</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tUnlike other species of bees, B. affinis queens harvest nectar via \\"nectar spur perforation\\" or \\"nectar robbing\\". This unique harvesting behavior is accomplished through a number of maneuvers. A B. affinis queen must first hang inverted from the edges of the inner petals (occasionally using a neighboring flower to steady herself). After squeezing her head in the space between the inner and outer petals, and using her front legs to push the inner petal forward, she will perforate the inner petal to gain easy access to the spur. Because B. affinis has a relatively short tongue, this enables them to have easy access to the spurs, where nectar is abundant (Other species of bee, such as B. fervidus have much longer tongues, which allows them to gather nectar via the flower\'s primary opening). After gathering the nectar, the queen then rotates her head, sweeps pollen from her legs, and leaves. This behavior does not affect plant fertility, nor does it prevent cross pollination from taking place (as evidenced by the presence of fruit on plants with perforated spurs).</p>\\r\\n\\t<hr />\\r\\n\\t<p><strong>References:</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombus_affinis\\">wikipedia</a><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t<a href=\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/science/endangered-bee.html\\">NY Times article</a><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t<a href=\\"http://www.discoverlife.org/20/q?search=Bombus+affinis\\">Discover Life</a></p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n",

Because of its body size and fury appearance, however, this bee is often confused with other species of bumblebee, such as B. citrinus, B. griseocollis, B. perplexus, and B. vagans.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Furthermore, male and female workers of B. affinis also differ in terms of their appearance and body size. Male workers are typically slightly larger than females (13–17.5 millimetres (0.51–0.69 in) in length), and have a few off-white/pale hairs that are present on top of their head. They also have black hair which will sometimes streak across the top of the abdomen (which is typically yellow). Finally, males can even have pale yellow hair on the abdomen, as opposed to the normal shade of yellow that is observed in females and queens.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Nests</em><br />\\n\\t\\tMembers of B. affinis are known to build their nests underground in locations such as ditches on the side of the road, wetlands, and fields. However, there are instances where nests are constructed above ground in chunks of grass and dirt, which can be limited by the availability of open grasslands. An interesting fact about the B. affinis nest is that a nest was once found inside an armchair that was abandoned outside. When nests are constructed underground though, they are typically located 16–18 inches (410–460 mm) below the surface, and are composed of soft dirt.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong><br />\\n\\t\\tB. affinis requires three different types of habitats (each for foraging, nesting, and hibernating) which are geographically close to one another; making this species particularly vulnerable to extinction. As previously mentioned, this species is commonly found in the eastern regions of the United States and Southern areas of Canada, including Ontario. It requires a temperate climate, and can even withstand cold temperatures that most species of bumblebees cannot. In addition, B. affinis has been found at elevations as high as 1600m. B. affinis is known to visit a number of sites for foraging, including sand dunes, farmland, and marshes, and wooded areas. Members will actively forage between the months of April and October, and thus, require flowers to bloom for a lengthy amount of time. Furthermore, their nesting habitat is often found underground. B. affinis nests are strikingly similar to other species of bees, which makes them difficult to locate. However, queen and workers will work together to make individual cells and honey pots out of wax stores. In terms of their hibernating habitat, little information is known. It is not thought that B. affinis queens will overwinter, however, they most likely will live underground or burrow into rotting logs during the winter time to survive. While B. affinis\' habitat used to be highly prevalent, there has been a large decline in recent years, possibly due to increased land development and agricultural use.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Until the 1980s, it was one of the most common species of bumblebee in southern Ontario. Since then, the species has had a drastic decline in number and is now difficult to find in its normal range. The only locality within Ontario where the rusty-patched bumblebee has been seen in the last five years is Pinery Provincial Park (Lambton County), despite widespread surveys in Ontario. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources has begun a recovery project aimed at protecting the species and critical habitats centered in Pinery Provincial Park. These threats have been proposed as the cause of population decline: pathogen spillover from other species, pesticide use, and habitat fragmentation and loss. Surveys from 2001–2008 have located Bombus affinis populations only in Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, and southern Ontario.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Colony cycle</strong><br />\\n\\t\\t<em>Colony initiation and growth</em><br />\\n\\t\\tNew colonies are started by B. affinis in the spring and decline in the fall. Members of this species will actually emerge before most other species of Bombus, and will continue foraging after other species have begun hibernating. Solitary queens will be the first to emerge and begin searching for a colony, while also collecting nectar and pollen to feed her future brood. The queen uses sperm she has saved from her mating activities of the previous fall to fertilize her eggs. Eggs will hatch about four days after fertilization, but will take up to 5 weeks to become completely developed adults depending on temperature and food availability. In the first few weeks after laying her brood, the queen is solely responsible for feeding her young.However, shortly afterwards, her female worker offspring will begin collecting food for the colony in preparation for more offspring. Once the workers are able to become the primary caretakers of the nest, the queen can focus on laying more eggs. At this point (which is about halfway through the summer) the number of workers will reach an optimal number and the queen will begin producing males and potential queens. Colony sizes can range anywhere from 50 to approximately 400 individuals, although colonies that are raised in captivity are known to get much larger, having as many members as 2100.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Colony decline</em><br />\\n\\t\\tDuring this half-way point in the summer, any members with reproductive potential will leave the nest and begin mating. The number of potential queens that can be produced is heavily reliant on the amount of nectar and pollen that can gathered during this time. Thus, a shortage of food may result in lesser queen production, and vice versa. But because solitary queens are the only members of the B. affinis that can initiate new colonies, the success of future colonies is dependent on queen production. Furthermore, after mating, new queens will rest and enter into diapause, or hibernation for the winter. Male members and workers will decline as the weather gets colder, and will eventually die when winter comes. Thus, colonies live for about 4–5 months depending on the environmental conditions. It is important to note that it is common for queens to die at different times throughout colony production, which can often lead to orphaned colonies. Queens typically live for about 77 days on average, from the time the colony is created until the time that the queen dies.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Reproductive suppression</strong><br />\\n\\t\\tSimilar to other social insects, egg laying by B. affinis workers is suppressed by the presence of a dominant queen that is capable of reproducing. The queen\'s position as a dominant member or leader of the colony is made known through both pheromones and behavioral patterns. However, it is strictly the presence of specific pheromones that suppress gonadotropic hormones in B. affinis workers, leading to suppressed reproductive potential. Recent studies have revealed that there is variability in dominance signals both between certain species, and also between subspecies or subgenera. For example, in B. terrestris colonies, it is presence or absence of abdominal glands rather than pheromones that dictates the dominance of the queen. In the absence of a fecund queen, aggression and violence between workers increases quickly. In addition, ovarian weight is significantly lower in colonies where the queen is present than when she is removed.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">It was previously thought that Bombus bohemicus (an obligate brood parasite of B. affinis) also played a role in suppressing ovarian development in B. affinis, however, it has recently been discovered that this is not the case. Members of the Psithyrus genus will often maul other members of the host colony, which indirectly decreases the number of eggs laid in the host colony. B. bohemicus does not demonstrate this behavior, and actually has worse chances of survival in nests where there is not a dominant queen present, due to increased aggression by B. affinis members. However, it is important to note that while ovarian development is not impacted by the presence of B. bohemicus, overall reproductive success is decreased due to consumption of the host eggs and larval ejection.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Kin selection</strong><br />\\n\\t\\t<em>Genetic relatedness</em><br />\\n\\t\\tGenetic relatedness within the B. affinis species varies depending on the relationship. Because members are haplodiploid making males haploid and females diploid, so genetic relatedness is asymmetrical, causing workers to be more closely related to their sisters than their brothers. B. affinis workers share a correlation coefficient (or variable indicating the strength of the relatedness/ degree of relatedness) of r = 0.75 with full sisters but only r = 0.25 for full brothers. In addition, workers are also much more closely related to their sons than their own brothers, and even more so than their nephews. The r value is likely greater than 0.5 for sons. While it is advantageous for ratio of males to queens to be 1:1 normally, this asymmetry in genetic relatedness results in much conflict between the queen and the workers. Thus, all members who are workers should demonstrate favor for a predominantly female population (if the queen is the major egg layer in the colony).</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Worker/queen conflict</em><br />\\n\\t\\tDifferences in genetic relatedness can result in conflict between the B. affinis queen and workers. This conflict can manifest itself in one of two ways - either through a skewed sex ratio with the absence of any physical aggression, or through direct contact in which one member will act violently towards another member to inhibit reproductive success. Should aggression manifest itself as skewed sex ratios, the ratio of male to female offspring varies depending on the contribution from queens and workers. For example, if there is no worker contribution, the ratio will be 1:3 (males to females), however, if contribution is solely from workers, then the ratio be far closer to 1:1. However, should the aggression manifest itself as violent behaviors, they will often be directed toward a member\'s brood, through actions such as larval ejection. This larval ejection is often associated with the degradation of group cohesion, and typically occurs at a late stage in colony development. It can also be the result of workers attempt to lay their own eggs, independently of the queen.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Interaction with other species</strong><br />\\n\\t\\t<em>Parasites</em><br />\\n\\t\\tB. affinis is parasitized most extensively by a separate species of bee, Bombus bohemicus, which is an obligate brood parasite. B. bohemicus will end hibernation shortly after B. affinis, and search for their established nests, however, the exact mechanism is unknown. It is thought that female members of B. bohemicus are able to locate the host nests by identifying the odor from a distance—without ever having physical contact with the nest or regions that were utilized by workers. By flying low to the ground and searching carefully (even by looking near leaves and debris), B. bohemicus may first locate the entrance of a B. affinis nest, and then verify their findings via odor identification. After invading the nest, however, the B. bohemicus will live alongside the queen and the workers, and will also attempt to rear their own brood (who must be raised with host workers\' help). Because larger nests tend to have more workers defending the nest, B. bohemicus often invades smaller nests, which forces it to occupy smaller nests for larger periods of time B. bohemicus is uniquely found in the nests of B. affinis and B. terricola, where it is usually tolerated if unnoticed. However, B. affinis has been known to exhibit oophagy (or consumption of non-host eggs), larval ejection, and ejection of the parasite in response to parasite presence. Should B. bohemicus make a mistake in invading the nests of other species, they will be attacked by the queen, whose violent actions often end in their death.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Diet</em><br />\\n\\t\\tB. affinis consumes the nectar and pollen of a variety of nototrobic plant species, including the Lobelia siphilitica, Linaria vulgaris, and Antirrhinum majus. Dicentra cucullaria, a type of flowering plant, is particularly dependent on members of the B. affinis for sexual reproduction. In fact, the flower structure and mechanism by which it is pollinated indicate that it is adapted for foragers such as B. affinis, which can separate the outer and inner petals of the flower. Members will then use their front legs to expose the stigma, stamen, and anthers. Shortly afterwards, they will sweep pollen in a forward stroke by utilizing their middle legs, before leaving the flower to return to the colony with the pollen. In this way, the D. cucullaria is pollinated as the bees move from plant to plant, and the B. affinis meets its dietary needs. This pollen foraging behavior is strikingly similar to bees of the genus Apis. Species of the Apis variety are lighter in weight though, making it slightly more difficult to gain access.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><em>Disease</em><br />\\n\\t\\tB. affinis is susceptible to a certain species of protozoa, known as Apicystis bombi. This pathogen impacts about 3% of all Bombus affinis, and is particularly prevalent in Ontario, Canada. A. bombi first infects the gut of its host, then spreads this infection to the rest of the body. While its transmission is not well understood, A. bombi causes multiple negative impacts, including increased death of worker bees, and the prevention of formation of new colonies. It also limits ovarian development of queens, and reduces their lifespans. Its thought that this disease was introduced to North America by commercial B. terrestris in the early in early 2005 or 2006 when members invaded northern Patagonia, Argentina from Europe. A. bombi rarely impacts bees occupying Europe (only about 6-8% show signs of infection), however, for European bees living in Patagonia, incidence of infection is closer to about 50% in certain species. Because of this, there is great concern by conservation experts that A. bombi may be detrimental to several bumblebee species, including B. affinis.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Importance in agriculture</strong><br />\\n\\t\\tB. affinis is important to the agricultural industry. It is known that members of this species pollinate up to 65 different species of plants, and is the primary pollinator of key dietary crops, such as cranberries, plums, apples, onions, and alfalfa. These crops are important for day-to-day consumption by humans, but are also vital to sustaining other birds and mammals that feed on their fruit. Plants pollinated by B. affinis (such as Aralia and Spiraea) are used medicinally by aboriginal peoples of Canada known as the First Nations. Thus, the recent decline of B. affinis could have far reaching affects on ecosystems, economic stability, and cultural traditions.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In 2008 it was reported that three recent events had led to the decline of B. affinis\' agricultural role: pathogen spillover, pesticide use, and habitat loss. Many bumblebees that are used in commercial businesses harbor harmful parasites that can impact nearby wild populations of B. affinis. This often has lethal effects, and has led to the decline of B. terricola and B. impatiens, the common eastern bumblebee, as well. Aside from pathogen spillover, however, novel pesticides also impact populations of B. affinis. Neonicotinoids in particular are pesticides that are toxic to bees, however, they are commonly used for pest control on crops and turf. Because B. affinis nests are built underground, they are uniquely susceptible to this pesticide\'s use on turf. Lastly, increases in urbanization and industrialization have meant the loss of native habitats. While other species such as B. bimaculatus, the two-spotted bumble bee, have adapted well to urban environments, B. affinis has not. It is not known, however, whether or not the reduction of native food plants in particular has impacted B. affinis.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Nectar robbing</strong><br />\\n\\t\\tUnlike other species of bees, B. affinis queens harvest nectar via \\"nectar spur perforation\\" or \\"nectar robbing\\". This unique harvesting behavior is accomplished through a number of maneuvers. A B. affinis queen must first hang inverted from the edges of the inner petals (occasionally using a neighboring flower to steady herself). After squeezing her head in the space between the inner and outer petals, and using her front legs to push the inner petal forward, she will perforate the inner petal to gain easy access to the spur. Because B. affinis has a relatively short tongue, this enables them to have easy access to the spurs, where nectar is abundant (Other species of bee, such as B. fervidus have much longer tongues, which allows them to gather nectar via the flower\'s primary opening). After gathering the nectar, the queen then rotates her head, sweeps pollen from her legs, and leaves. This behavior does not affect plant fertility, nor does it prevent cross pollination from taking place (as evidenced by the presence of fruit on plants with perforated spurs).</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p><strong>References:</strong><br />\\n\\t\\t<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombus_affinis\\">wikipedia</a><br />\\n\\t\\t<a href=\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/science/endangered-bee.html\\">NY Times article</a><br />\\n\\t\\t<a href=\\"http://www.discoverlife.org/20/q?search=Bombus+affinis\\">Discover Life</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<p> </p>\\n",

A positive identification can be made with molecular analyses such as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP).</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">B. xylophilus is distinguished by three characteristics: the spicule is flattened into a disc-shaped cucullus at the tip, the front vulval lip is flap-like, and the tail of the female is rounded.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Life cycle</strong><br />\\r\\n\\tThe pine wilt nematode has a typical nematode life cycle, with four juvenile stages and an adult stage with both male and female individuals that reproduce sexually. The mycophagous phase of the life cycle takes place in dead or dying wood, where the nematodes live and feed upon fungi, rather than the wood itself. The nematode cannot travel outside of the wood independently; it must be transported by an insect vector.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">B. xylophilus has the shortest life cycle of any known parasitic nematode. In laboratory studies in which it is cultured on fungal media, its life cycle is completed in four days. In nature it reproduces most rapidly in the summer, producing large numbers of individuals that spread throughout the resin canal system of susceptible pines, into the trunk, the branches, and the roots. If living tree cells are no longer available the parasite feeds and reproduces on the fungal hyphae growing in the resin canals. In the fall and winter the parasite becomes inactive.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Vectors</strong><br />\\r\\n\\tAs soon as the pathogen of nematode was known, Monochamus alternatus, sawyer beetle, it had been one of the noticed insects because this sawyer found frequently dead pine trees, prove the important vector of the nematode and know that the nematode infected healthy pine trees. The nematodes drop off the sawyer, and infect healthy pine tree when the adult sawyers eat the young pine branches.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The pine wilt nematode is vectored by a number of bark beetles and wood borers, and is most often associated with beetles in the genus Monochamus, the pine sawyers. Pine sawyers lay their eggs in the bark of dead timber. The growing larva feeds on the wood and pupates in the resulting cavity. Nematodes of the third juvenile stage congregate in the cavity around the pupa, molt into the fourth juvenile stage, and invade the trachea of the adult beetle. During this dispersive stage the beetle transports the nematode to other trees.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Mechanism of wilt and spread</strong><br />\\r\\n\\tThe mechanism from nematode infection to finally pine death is partially unknown now, but the outline has been recognized. The cause of pine death is stopping moving water in the timber. The phenomenon is caused by small bubbles, then air embolism of xylem tissue stops water movement. The embolism doesn’t make tylose or clog the nematode or pine cell. Why the several cavitation and non-reversible embolism occur, is unknown. In primary transmission, when the beetle feeds on a susceptible host pine, the pine wilt nematode enters the tree and feeds on the epithelial cells which line the resin ducts. This is referred to as the phytophagous phase of the nematode, and it results in pine wilt disease. Water transport in the tissues of the infested tree is disrupted, and the disease can manifest within a few weeks. Signs include browning of the needles or yellowing of the leaves, and the tree may die within two to three months.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Grade of resistance</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tFuruno(1982) observed standing pine trees in Japanese forest, and ranked their resistance to pine wood nematode.The \\"High resistance\\" pines are rarely killed by the nematode , but young saplings or trees in weakened condition may succumb.\\r\\n\\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>High resistance</u></p>\\r\\n\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus taeda</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;elliottii</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;palustris</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;rigida</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;taiwanensis</li>\\r\\n\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Low resistance</u></p>\\r\\n\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;strobus</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;massoniana</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;resinosa</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus tabulaeformis</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;banksiana</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;contorta</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;thumb × Pinus&nbsp;masso</li>\\r\\n\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Low susceptible</u></p>\\r\\n\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;bungeana</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;monticola</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;parviflora</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;strobiformis</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;densiflora</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;pinaster</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;sylvestris</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;ponderosa</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;rudis</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;pseudostrobus</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;oocarpa</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;radiata</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;greggii</li>\\r\\n\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Highly susceptible</u></p>\\r\\n\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;koraiensis</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;leiophylla</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus luchuensis</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;thunbergii</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;nigra</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;mugo</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;khasya</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus&nbsp;muricata</li>\\r\\n\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Management</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tIn Japan, scientists and officers think that the mainstream of prevent this disease is removing sawyers, the vector of the nematode. The sawyers like to spawn at dying or dead pine trees, so they advise to cut down these trees until next spring. Then the timber chipped, burned or sprayed insecticide to kill the sawyer larva and pupa in them.The adult sawyers go out from the timber in late spring or early summer. They start eating young pine branch, and the nematode dropping from the sawyer. Among the two event has a few time lag. So, it is profitable to kill the adult sawyers at this time to prevent the nematode infection to other trees. In Japan, the insecticide to the sawyers use organophosphorus compound or neonicotinoid. For example fenitrothion, malathion, acetamiprid, and thiacloprid. Some environmentalist warn and oppose to use these insecticide.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Bioinsecticides to remove the sawyers are studying. Entomopathogenic fungus, woodpeckers and some parasitoid or prey insects are noticed and continue studying.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Embargoes have been placed on untreated lumber from the United States and Canada. Management practices have concentrated on preventing the spread of the nematode. Infected trees are cut and either burned or chipped, soft wood timber is stripped of its bark to prevent oviposition by vectors, and all lumber shipped overseas is either fumigated or kiln-dried. Despite these preventative measures the nematode has been confirmed in Portugal, and may spread in Europe.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In Japan, some nematocides use to prevent the disease. For example, morantel, mesulfenfos, levamisole, emamectin, milbemectin, thionazin. Some biopesticides are studying, but they remain expelimental stage.

A positive identification can be made with molecular analyses such as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP).</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">B. xylophilus is distinguished by three characteristics: the spicule is flattened into a disc-shaped cucullus at the tip, the front vulval lip is flap-like, and the tail of the female is rounded.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Life cycle</strong><br />\\n\\tThe pine wilt nematode has a typical nematode life cycle, with four juvenile stages and an adult stage with both male and female individuals that reproduce sexually. The mycophagous phase of the life cycle takes place in dead or dying wood, where the nematodes live and feed upon fungi, rather than the wood itself. The nematode cannot travel outside of the wood independently; it must be transported by an insect vector.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">B. xylophilus has the shortest life cycle of any known parasitic nematode. In laboratory studies in which it is cultured on fungal media, its life cycle is completed in four days. In nature it reproduces most rapidly in the summer, producing large numbers of individuals that spread throughout the resin canal system of susceptible pines, into the trunk, the branches, and the roots. If living tree cells are no longer available the parasite feeds and reproduces on the fungal hyphae growing in the resin canals. In the fall and winter the parasite becomes inactive.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Vectors</strong><br />\\n\\tAs soon as the pathogen of nematode was known, Monochamus alternatus, sawyer beetle, it had been one of the noticed insects because this sawyer found frequently dead pine trees, prove the important vector of the nematode and know that the nematode infected healthy pine trees. The nematodes drop off the sawyer, and infect healthy pine tree when the adult sawyers eat the young pine branches.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The pine wilt nematode is vectored by a number of bark beetles and wood borers, and is most often associated with beetles in the genus Monochamus, the pine sawyers. Pine sawyers lay their eggs in the bark of dead timber. The growing larva feeds on the wood and pupates in the resulting cavity. Nematodes of the third juvenile stage congregate in the cavity around the pupa, molt into the fourth juvenile stage, and invade the trachea of the adult beetle. During this dispersive stage the beetle transports the nematode to other trees.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Mechanism of wilt and spread</strong><br />\\n\\tThe mechanism from nematode infection to finally pine death is partially unknown now, but the outline has been recognized. The cause of pine death is stopping moving water in the timber. The phenomenon is caused by small bubbles, then air embolism of xylem tissue stops water movement. The embolism doesn’t make tylose or clog the nematode or pine cell. Why the several cavitation and non-reversible embolism occur, is unknown. In primary transmission, when the beetle feeds on a susceptible host pine, the pine wilt nematode enters the tree and feeds on the epithelial cells which line the resin ducts. This is referred to as the phytophagous phase of the nematode, and it results in pine wilt disease. Water transport in the tissues of the infested tree is disrupted, and the disease can manifest within a few weeks. Signs include browning of the needles or yellowing of the leaves, and the tree may die within two to three months.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Grade of resistance</p>\\n<p>\\tFuruno(1982) observed standing pine trees in Japanese forest, and ranked their resistance to pine wood nematode.The \\"High resistance\\" pines are rarely killed by the nematode , but young saplings or trees in weakened condition may succumb.</p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>High resistance</u></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus taeda</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus elliottii</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus palustris</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus rigida</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus taiwanensis</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Low resistance</u></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus strobus</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus massoniana</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus resinosa</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus tabulaeformis</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus banksiana</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus contorta</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus thumb × Pinus masso</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Low susceptible</u></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus bungeana</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus monticola</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus parviflora</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus strobiformis</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus densiflora</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus pinaster</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus sylvestris</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus ponderosa</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus rudis</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus pseudostrobus</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus oocarpa</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus radiata</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus greggii</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Highly susceptible</u></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus koraiensis</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus leiophylla</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus luchuensis</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus thunbergii</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus nigra</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus mugo</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus khasya</li>\\n<li class=\\"rtejustify\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tPinus muricata</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Management</strong><br />\\n\\t\\tIn Japan, scientists and officers think that the mainstream of prevent this disease is removing sawyers, the vector of the nematode. The sawyers like to spawn at dying or dead pine trees, so they advise to cut down these trees until next spring. Then the timber chipped, burned or sprayed insecticide to kill the sawyer larva and pupa in them.The adult sawyers go out from the timber in late spring or early summer. They start eating young pine branch, and the nematode dropping from the sawyer. Among the two event has a few time lag. So, it is profitable to kill the adult sawyers at this time to prevent the nematode infection to other trees. In Japan, the insecticide to the sawyers use organophosphorus compound or neonicotinoid. For example fenitrothion, malathion, acetamiprid, and thiacloprid. Some environmentalist warn and oppose to use these insecticide.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Bioinsecticides to remove the sawyers are studying. Entomopathogenic fungus, woodpeckers and some parasitoid or prey insects are noticed and continue studying.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Embargoes have been placed on untreated lumber from the United States and Canada. Management practices have concentrated on preventing the spread of the nematode. Infected trees are cut and either burned or chipped, soft wood timber is stripped of its bark to prevent oviposition by vectors, and all lumber shipped overseas is either fumigated or kiln-dried. Despite these preventative measures the nematode has been confirmed in Portugal, and may spread in Europe.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In Japan, some nematocides use to prevent the disease. For example, morantel, mesulfenfos, levamisole, emamectin, milbemectin, thionazin. Some biopesticides are studying, but they remain expelimental stage. Inoculte nematode and nematophagous fungus same pine timber, the nematode decrease.</p>\\n</div>\\n<hr />\\n<p><strong>Reference</strong><br />\\n\\t<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bursaphelenchus_xylophilus\\" target=\\"_blank\\">wikipedia</a> <a href=\\"http://plpnemweb.ucdavis.edu/nemaplex/Taxadata/G145s1.HTM\\" target=\\"_blank\\">ucdavis</a></p>\\n",

Some species of octopus in this group live inside jellyfish or salps — gelatinous, barrel-shaped animals related to vertebrates (including people). Others brandish the stinging tentacles of the Portuguese man-of-war and other gelatinous animals, possibly to use in catching prey.

            \'safe_value\' => "<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Haliphron atlanticus is one of the two largest known species of octopus; based on scientific records, it has a maximum estimated total length of 3.5 m (11 ft) and mass of 75 kg (165 lb). The only other similarly large extant species is the giant Pacific octopus, Enteroctopus dofleini.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The genera Alloposina Grimpe, 1922, Alloposus Verrill, 1880 and <span style=\\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\\">Heptapus</span> Joubin, 1929 are junior synonyms of Haliphron.</p>\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Description</strong><br />\\n\\t\\tThe seven-arm octopus is so named because in males the hectocotylus (a specially modified arm used in egg fertilization) is coiled in a sac beneath the right eye. Due to this species\' thick gelatinous tissue, the arm is easily overlooked, giving the appearance of just seven arms. However, like other octopuses, it actually has eight.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Distribution</strong><br />\\n\\t\\tThe type specimen of H. atlanticus was collected in the Atlantic Ocean at 38°N 34°W. It is deposited at the Zoologisk Museum, University of Copenhagen.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">In 2002, a single specimen of giant proportions was caught by fishermen trawling at a depth of 920 m off the eastern Chatham Rise, New Zealand. This specimen, the largest of this species and of all octopodes, was the first validated record of Haliphron from the South Pacific. It had a mantle length of 0.69 m (2.3 ft), a total length of 2.90 m (9.5 ft), and a weight of 61.0 kg (134.5 lb), although it was incomplete.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Nature Article: Over easy</strong><br />\\n\\t\\tScientists from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) spotted the female octopus in July 2013 off the coast of California — only the team\'s third sighting of the species in 27 years. The seven-arm octopus actually has eight arms, but the male carries one tucked in a sac beneath its eye, giving rise to its common name.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The species is part of a larger group of octopuses that are known for their close interactions with jellies and other gelatinous creatures, says Steve Haddock, a marine biologist at MBARI in Moss Landing, California, and one of the authors of the study. Some species of octopus in this group live inside jellyfish or salps — gelatinous, barrel-shaped animals related to vertebrates (including people). Others brandish the stinging tentacles of the Portuguese man-of-war and other gelatinous animals, possibly to use in catching prey. Haliphron atlanticus was the last one in the group that didn’t seem to be interacting with jellies — until now, Haddock says.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Researchers corroborated their seven-armed-octopus footage with the gut contents of preserved museum specimens collected in the 1970s and 1990s.

It has a pale face with dark rings around the eyes, a yellow beak and brown eyes. It is the only true owl of the eastern United States which has brown eyes; all others have yellow eyes. The upper parts are mottled gray-brown. The underparts are light with markings; the chest is barred horizontally while the belly is streaked vertically (hence its name \\"barred owl\\"). The legs and feet are covered in feathers up to the talons. The head is round and lacks ear tufts.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Outside of the closely related spotted owl, this streaky, dark-eyed, chunky-looking owl is unlikely to be confused over most of the range. The spotted owl is similar in appearance, but is slightly smaller and has spots rather than streaks down the underside. The great horned owl is much larger, has ear tufts, and has yellow eyes.</p>\\r\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Distribution and habitat<br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe barred owl is distributed throughout most of the eastern United States, as well as much of southern Canada. Their range extends to British Columbia, and from there they have moved into the northwest United States. In the states of Washington, Oregon and California, barred owls have engulfed the range of the native northern spotted owl with which they now compete.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The historical lack of trees in the Great Plains acted as a barrier to the range expansion and recent increases in forests broke down this barrier. Increases in forest distribution along the Missouri River and its tributaries provided barred owls with sufficient foraging habitat, protection from the weather, and concealment from avian predators to allow barred owls to move westward. Decades later, increases in forests in the northern Great Plains allowed them to connect their eastern and western distributions across southern Canada. These increases in forests were caused by European-American settlers via their exclusion of fires historically set by Native Americans, by their suppression of accidental fires and by increased tree-planting; to a lesser degree this regional net forest increase was also caused by these settlers\' extirpating bison (Bison bison) and by overhunting elk (Cervus elaphus), deer (Odocoileus spp.) and, in some areas, by extirpating beaver (Castor canadensis) and replacing native ungulates with livestock. Increase in trees in the Great Plains from fire suppression or tree planting is considered a main cause of the range expansions of many other species of birds including western kingbird (Tyrannus verticalis), eastern phoebe (Sayornis phoebe), eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis), blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata), brown thrasher (Toxostoma rufum), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), and American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchus).</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Breeding habitats are dense woods across Canada, the United States, and south to Mexico. The cinereous owl, or Mexican barred owl, is sometimes considered a separate species for the Mexican population, but so far the American Ornithological Society has not recognized it as distinct. The barred owl is particularly numerous in a variety of wooded habitats in the southeastern United States. Recent studies show suburban neighborhoods can be ideal habitat for barred owls. Using transmitters, scientists found that some regional populations increased faster in the suburban settings than in old growth forest. A factor of this suburban success may be easily accessible rodent prey in such settings. However, for breeding and roosting needs, this species needs at least some large trees and can be locally absent in some urban areas for this reason. The main danger to owls in suburban settings is from cars. The increased offspring offset the death rate due to impacts from cars and disease. On the contrary studies from the Northeastern United States, such as in New Jersey, found barred owls breeding mainly in plots of old-growth woodlands and rarely successfully breed in peri-urban areas, in part because of competitive and predatory displacement by great horned owls.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Barred owls are partly responsible for the recent decline of the northern spotted owl, native to British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California. The 2011 Revised Recovery Plan for the Northern Spotted Owl (p. vi) states “Based on the best available scientific information, competition from the barred owl (S. varia) poses a significant and complex threat to the spotted owl.” Since the 1960s, barred owls have been expanding their range westward from the eastern US and Canada (see “Distribution and habitat” section above). When spotted owls and barred owls share the same area, the barred owls generally are more aggressive and out-compete the spotted owls, leading to decreased populations of the native owls. Barred owls may even kill spotted owls. Barred owls and spotted owls occasionally interbreed, creating hybrids (\\"sparred owl\\" or \\"botted owl\\"). Only 47 hybrids with barred owls were found in an analysis of more than 9000 banded spotted owls; consequently, hybridization between these two species is considered by the authors of that analysis to be “an interesting biological phenomenon that is probably inconsequential compared with the real threat—direct competition between the two species for food and space” (p. 808).</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">On 5 April 2007, White House officials announced a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposal to shoot barred owls to reduce the threat they pose to the spotted owl. It called for delineating 18 sites within the range of the spotted owl where 12–32 barred owls would be taken per site for 5 to 10 years. Approximately 2150 to 2850 barred owls would be killed for a 3- to 5-year study, and 4650 Barred Owls would be killed for a 10-year study If the precedent-setting removal study is implemented, it would, during its first year, result in the death of 36 times more raptors than in all other conservation-based projects combined in the United States and its territories, and 84 times more raptors than in the largest ongoing effort worldwide, at a cost of $1 million annually; simplifying the cost to dollars per barred owl killed approximates $700 per barred owl for the first year and $2800 per barred owl for each subsequent year. Many environmentalists fear increased blame on barred owls for declining spotted owl numbers will result in less attention being paid to territorial protection and resumption of logging in protected spotted owl habitat.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Behavior</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\t<u>Reproduction</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe barred owl\'s nest is often in a tree cavity, often ones created by pileated woodpeckers; it may also take over an old nesting site made previously by a red-shouldered hawk, Cooper\'s hawk, crow, or squirrel. It is a permanent resident, but may wander after the nesting season. If a nest site has proved suitable in the past they will often reuse it as the birds are non-migratory. In the United States, eggs are laid from early-January in southern Florida to mid-April in northern Maine, and consist of 2 to 4 eggs per clutch. Eggs are brooded by the female with hatching taking place approximately 4 weeks later. Young owls fledge four to five weeks after hatching. These owls have few predators, but young, unwary owls may be taken by cats. The most significant predator of barred owls is the great horned owl. The barred owl has been known to live up to 24 years in the wild and 23 years in captivity.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><u>Food and feeding</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe barred owl is a generalist predator. The principal prey of this owl are meadow voles, followed by mice and shrews of various species; other mammals preyed upon include rats, squirrels, rabbits, bats, moles, opossums, mink, and weasels. A barred owl was photographed in Minnesota in 2012 grabbing and flying off with a full-grown domestic cat, a semi-regular prey item for the great horned owl but previously unknown to be taken by this species. Birds are taken occasionally and commonly include woodpeckers, grouse, quails, jays, icterids, doves, pigeons and even domestic ducks, and chickens, where they will swoop through small openings in enclosed and covered runs. Less commonly, other raptors are preyed upon, including smaller owls. Avian prey are typically taken as they settle into nocturnal roosts, because these owls are not generally nimble enough to catch birds on the wing. It occasionally wades into water to capture fish, turtles, frogs and crayfish. Additional prey include snakes, lizards, salamanders, slugs, scorpions, beetles, crickets, grasshoppers, and earthworms. Barred owls have been known to be attracted to campfires and lights where they forage for large insects. Prey is usually devoured on the spot. Larger prey is carried to a feeding perch and torn apart before eating.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The barred owl hunts by waiting on a high perch at night, or flying through the woods and swooping down on prey. A barred owl can sometimes be seen hunting before dark. This typically occurs during the nesting season or on dark and cloudy days. Of the North American owls, the pygmy, hawk, snowy and burrowing owls are more likely to be active during the day. Daytime activity is often most prevalent when barred owls are raising chicks. However, this species still generally hunts near dawn or dusk.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Vocalization<br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe usual call is a series of eight accented hoots ending in oo-aw, with a downward pitch at the end. The most common mnemonic device for remembering the call is \\"Who cooks for you, who cooks for you all.\\" It is noisy in most seasons. When agitated, this species will make a buzzy, rasping hiss and click its beak together forcefully.

They have nasal tubes on the upper bill called naricorns, though with albatrosses these are on the sides of the upper mandible rather than the top. They also have a salt gland above the nasal passage which excretes a concentrated saline solution to maintain osmotic balance, due to the amount of seawater imbibed. The bills of the Procellariiformes are unique in that they are covered with from seven to nine horny plates. These birds produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus. This can be sprayed out of their mouths as a defence against predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights.</p>\\r\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Description</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe light-mantled albatross is largely sooty-brown or blackish, darker on the head, with paler upperparts from the nape to the upper tail-coverts which are grey to light grey, the palest on the mantle and back. The plumage has been described as being similar in appearance to the colouring of a Siamese cat. The eyes are partly encircled with thin post-orbital crescents of very short grey feathers. The bill is black with a blue sulcus and a greyish-yellow line along the lower mandible, and is about 105 mm (4.1 in). Measurements show that males and females are similar in size, with average length of 79 to 89 cm (31–35 in), wing-span of 183 to 218 cm (72–86 in), and weight of 2.5 to 3.7 kg (5.5–8.2 lb).</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Distribution and habitat</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe light-mantled albatross has a circumpolar pelagic distribution in the Southern Ocean. It ranges in latitude from the pack-ice around Antarctica, with the southernmost record from 78°S in the Ross Sea, to about 35°S, with occasional sightings further north along the Humboldt Current. It breeds on several subantarctic islands including the Prince Edward Island, Marion Island, Crozet Islands, Amsterdam Island, St. Paul Island, Kerguelen Islands, Heard Island, Macquarie Island, Campbell Island, Auckland Islands, Antipodes Islands and South Georgia and at least on one island in the maritime Antarctic at 62°S on King George Island. Except when breeding, its habitat is entirely marine, and it will forage from the edges of the Antarctic pack-ice to about 40°S. When foraging during the breeding season, the birds will remain closer to their nest sites.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Behavior</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThey have a loud shrill voice that is trumpet-like, and when threatened will snap their bills or utilize a throaty \\"gaaaa\\". When courting, they will utilize aerial displays and formation flying. They will also use mutual calling with deviations in tone brought occurring by head positioning, and finally, they use their tail in displays more than other albatrosses.<br />\\r\\n\\t\\t<em>Reproduction</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe species breeds in loose colonies or small groups, and sometimes is a solitary breeder. The nest is built on a vegetated cliff ledge, or a steep slope, sheltered from the prevailing westerly winds. Structurally it is a low mound of peat and mud, 15 to 30 cm (5.9–11.8 in) high and 45 to 55 cm (18–22 in) wide at the base, with a cupped hollow at the top. It incorporates some plant material and a grass lining. Around October or November, a single egg is laid, which is not replaced if lost. Both sexes incubate alternately in shifts that vary from a day or two up to nearly a month in length. The incubation period is 65 to 72 days. After hatching in December or January, which takes 3 to 5 days, the chicks are brooded in shifts for about 20 days, following which they are left alone in the nests while the adults forage, returning to feed the chicks by regurgitation every 2 to 3 days. The entire nestling period from hatching to fledging, which occurs in May or June, lasts 140 to 170 days. Pairs form committed pair-bonds which may last for decades, being renewed through complex courtship displays at the breeding site. On average, birds begin breeding when they are 8 to 15 years old, after which they breed biennially, fledging a chick every five years or so. They are capable of breeding until at least 32 years old and living to 40 or longer.<br />\\r\\n\\t\\t<em>Feeding</em><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe principal diet of light-mantled albatrosses consists of squid and krill, though other crustaceans and fish are taken as well as seal, penguin and petrel carrion. They sometimes feed in association with pilot whales and southern right whale dolphins, and occasionally follow ships. Food is usually taken on or close to the surface of the ocean, within a depth of 5 m (16 ft), though there is a record of a 12 m (39 ft) dive.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p><u>Conservation</u><br />\\r\\n\\t\\tThe light-mantled albatross population is estimated at about 58,000, from a 1998 estimate, and is declining. Threats and population status are poorly quantified and the species is classified as near threatened, with an occurrence range of 44,300,000 km2 (17,100,000 sq mi). Potential predators on some breeding islands are giant petrels, feral cats and rodents. At sea they are threatened by bycatch in the longline fishery and through starvation by eating plastic marine debris.</p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n",

Loud and steady chirps made throughout the night are to attract females and to warn off other males. Loud fast-frequency chirps are emitted when males encounter one another and are preparing to fight. They are intended to frighten off the rival male. There are two other chirp patterns that can be observed in their mating behaviors. A soft clipping sound, \'calling\' song, is made when a female is known to be nearby but in a certain distance, and more rigorous sound, \'courtship\' song, is made when a female is close enough to mate (mounting on the male\'s back). These two song can be easily distinguished by human ear based on its chirp patterns and frequency components.</p>\\r\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\r\\n<p><u>Song pattern and body size</u><br />\\r\\n\\tWhether cricket song pattern (e.g. frequency spectrum) reflect song-emitter\'s body size is controversial. A recent study failed to detect body-size effect on both calling and courtship songs of G. bimaculatus.</p>\\r\\n<p><u>Shelter</u><br />\\r\\n\\tThese crickets hide under logs, in grasses, and in crevices. They also dig holes in the ground to create homes, or live in holes created by other animals. Males are territorial and will fight off other males, but allow any number of females to coexist in the same shelter.</p>\\r\\n<p><u>Cannibalism</u><br />\\r\\n\\tCannibalism is extremely rare, but females have been observed to eat males if there is not enough food to eat.</p>\\r\\n<p><u>Circadian rhythm</u><br />\\r\\n\\tPigment Dispersing Factor has been implicated in the nocturnal rhythms of crickets.</p>\\r\\n<p><u>Breeding</u><br />\\r\\n\\tFemales have a tubular organ at the rear, known as an ovipositor, which is used to lay eggs into the ground. They lay their eggs into humid soil and the baby crickets hatch in about two weeks.</p>\\r\\n<p><u>Polygamy</u><br />\\r\\n\\tGryllus bimaculatus exhibit polygamy, in which one individual has many different mates. Variation of polygamous behavior occurs between males and females, within a population of Gryllus bimaculatus. Both females and males continuously seek mates with whom they can spread their seed. Polyandry is the most common form of polygamy practiced in G. bimaculatus. This means that female crickets will mate with more than one male. Male crickets do not exhibit polygyny.</p>\\r\\n<p><u>Polygamy in males</u><br />\\r\\n\\tThe rate at which males seek mates is unspecific but relatively high. This is due to anisogamy and their drive to pass on alleles while minimizing competition. Males will show the same drive to mate with previous mates as with new mates. The ability of a male cricket’s sperm to successfully fertilize a female’s egg after mating varies depending on various traits. An example of one trait that increases fertilization success is the amount of sperm that is effectively delivered through mating. The more sperm that is deposited results in greater fertilization success because more eggs are able to hatch. The order in which various males mate with one female before fertilization also affects fertilization success. The last male that mates with a female tends to have the highest fertilization success. Traits that increase the ability of a male’s sperm to successfully fertilize a female’s egg compared to that of another male are most advantageous. This is because these traits have been selected for over traits that have lower fertilization success.</p>\\r\\n<p><u>Polyandry</u><br />\\r\\n\\tFemales prefer to mate with certain males more than others. Females show a distinct preference for mating with new males. Female G. bimaculatus mate with at least two males before zygote production occurs. Polyandry is a costly reproductive system for females because they put a lot of time, energy and resources into producing eggs. It is not as costly for males because they can produce a larger amount of sperm for less time, energy and resources. Males can also fertilize many eggs in one mating. However, polyandry is still evolved in crickets because it provides benefits that outweigh the costs. It allows females to mate with males that have more desirable traits than previous mates, which is beneficial to offspring success. This multiple mate system allows new combinations of genes to come together, which results in more genetic variation in the population. It also allows females to avoid mating with infertile males. Two mechanisms that allow polyandry to be advantageous agents for increasing males\' fitness are sperm competition and male guarding behavior.</p>\\r\\n<p><u>Sperm competition</u><br />\\r\\n\\tSperm competition is the interaction between sperm traits and female selection of these traits. It allows males with more advantageous traits to survive and reproduce more than less fit males. In particular, competition among males causes sperm competition to increase. Sperm expenditure will increase when there is a higher risk of competition. Reproductive investment is metabolically straining, especially for males that have less desirable genes. These males have to invest even more resources into each reproductive opportunity when a mate competitor is in their environment. The amount of resources a male invests in producing a large amount of sperm, the greater the chances of successful fertilization. Sperm competition also helps to prevent crickets that have genomes that are too similar from mating. Inbreeding , which is when individuals who have closely related genomes mate, decreases the viability of cricket offspring and results in offspring with lower fitness. As a result, male crickets that are genetically similar to female mates tend to be less effective in producing healthy offspring that have high fitness. Females can avoid the costs of inbreeding by selecting sperm that are not genetically similar to their eggs.</p>\\r\\n<p><u>Male guarding behavior</u><br />\\r\\n\\tMale guarding behaviors are when male crickets guard female crickets after recently mating with them. These behaviors protect the guarding male’s sperm and allow this sperm to fertilize the female’s egg, despite the increase in predation of the guarding male. As a result, the guarding male’s advantageous traits are passed on. Male guarding behaviors also reduce the risk of females becoming prey. When males protect female mates from predators, these females are saved from death. This not only has the benefit of allowing that particular male’s sperm to become fertilized, but also allows the female to continue to survive and reproduce. This in turn can lead to increased mating and higher fitness between the female and guarding male.</p>\\r\\n<p><u>Novel mate hypothesis</u><br />\\r\\n\\tFemales of G. bimaculatus species prefer to mate with new, or \\"novel\\", mates. The Novel Mate hypothesis states that a female will avoid mating with males they have already mated with. The differentiation between previous mates and novel ones allows females to search for genetically superior males. Females are able to differentiate between novel and previous mates through odor cues. These are left behind by the female on the male to allow for sensory-differentiation. This self-referent chemosensory signaling is both a reliable and simple means for a female to maximize the benefits of polyandry. Females can also use palpation and antennation before mating to deduce whether or not a mate is novel.</p>\\r\\n<p><u>Economic importance</u><br />\\r\\n\\tGryllus bimaculatus is widely used by suppliers of live crickets for feeding to pet and zoo animals.</p>\\r\\n</div>",

A recent study failed to detect body-size effect on both calling and courtship songs of G. bimaculatus.</p>\\n<p><u>Shelter</u><br />\\n\\tThese crickets hide under logs, in grasses, and in crevices. They also dig holes in the ground to create homes, or live in holes created by other animals. Males are territorial and will fight off other males, but allow any number of females to coexist in the same shelter.</p>\\n<p><u>Cannibalism</u><br />\\n\\tCannibalism is extremely rare, but females have been observed to eat males if there is not enough food to eat.</p>\\n<p><u>Circadian rhythm</u><br />\\n\\tPigment Dispersing Factor has been implicated in the nocturnal rhythms of crickets.</p>\\n<p><u>Breeding</u><br />\\n\\tFemales have a tubular organ at the rear, known as an ovipositor, which is used to lay eggs into the ground. They lay their eggs into humid soil and the baby crickets hatch in about two weeks.</p>\\n<p><u>Polygamy</u><br />\\n\\tGryllus bimaculatus exhibit polygamy, in which one individual has many different mates. Variation of polygamous behavior occurs between males and females, within a population of Gryllus bimaculatus. Both females and males continuously seek mates with whom they can spread their seed. Polyandry is the most common form of polygamy practiced in G. bimaculatus. This means that female crickets will mate with more than one male. Male crickets do not exhibit polygyny.</p>\\n<p><u>Polygamy in males</u><br />\\n\\tThe rate at which males seek mates is unspecific but relatively high. This is due to anisogamy and their drive to pass on alleles while minimizing competition. Males will show the same drive to mate with previous mates as with new mates. The ability of a male cricket’s sperm to successfully fertilize a female’s egg after mating varies depending on various traits. An example of one trait that increases fertilization success is the amount of sperm that is effectively delivered through mating. The more sperm that is deposited results in greater fertilization success because more eggs are able to hatch. The order in which various males mate with one female before fertilization also affects fertilization success. The last male that mates with a female tends to have the highest fertilization success. Traits that increase the ability of a male’s sperm to successfully fertilize a female’s egg compared to that of another male are most advantageous. This is because these traits have been selected for over traits that have lower fertilization success.</p>\\n<p><u>Polyandry</u><br />\\n\\tFemales prefer to mate with certain males more than others. Females show a distinct preference for mating with new males. Female G. bimaculatus mate with at least two males before zygote production occurs. Polyandry is a costly reproductive system for females because they put a lot of time, energy and resources into producing eggs. It is not as costly for males because they can produce a larger amount of sperm for less time, energy and resources. Males can also fertilize many eggs in one mating. However, polyandry is still evolved in crickets because it provides benefits that outweigh the costs. It allows females to mate with males that have more desirable traits than previous mates, which is beneficial to offspring success. This multiple mate system allows new combinations of genes to come together, which results in more genetic variation in the population. It also allows females to avoid mating with infertile males. Two mechanisms that allow polyandry to be advantageous agents for increasing males\' fitness are sperm competition and male guarding behavior.</p>\\n<p><u>Sperm competition</u><br />\\n\\tSperm competition is the interaction between sperm traits and female selection of these traits. It allows males with more advantageous traits to survive and reproduce more than less fit males. In particular, competition among males causes sperm competition to increase. Sperm expenditure will increase when there is a higher risk of competition. Reproductive investment is metabolically straining, especially for males that have less desirable genes. These males have to invest even more resources into each reproductive opportunity when a mate competitor is in their environment. The amount of resources a male invests in producing a large amount of sperm, the greater the chances of successful fertilization. Sperm competition also helps to prevent crickets that have genomes that are too similar from mating. Inbreeding , which is when individuals who have closely related genomes mate, decreases the viability of cricket offspring and results in offspring with lower fitness. As a result, male crickets that are genetically similar to female mates tend to be less effective in producing healthy offspring that have high fitness. Females can avoid the costs of inbreeding by selecting sperm that are not genetically similar to their eggs.</p>\\n<p><u>Male guarding behavior</u><br />\\n\\tMale guarding behaviors are when male crickets guard female crickets after recently mating with them. These behaviors protect the guarding male’s sperm and allow this sperm to fertilize the female’s egg, despite the increase in predation of the guarding male. As a result, the guarding male’s advantageous traits are passed on. Male guarding behaviors also reduce the risk of females becoming prey. When males protect female mates from predators, these females are saved from death. This not only has the benefit of allowing that particular male’s sperm to become fertilized, but also allows the female to continue to survive and reproduce. This in turn can lead to increased mating and higher fitness between the female and guarding male.</p>\\n<p><u>Novel mate hypothesis</u><br />\\n\\tFemales of G. bimaculatus species prefer to mate with new, or \\"novel\\", mates. The Novel Mate hypothesis states that a female will avoid mating with males they have already mated with. The differentiation between previous mates and novel ones allows females to search for genetically superior males. Females are able to differentiate between novel and previous mates through odor cues. These are left behind by the female on the male to allow for sensory-differentiation. This self-referent chemosensory signaling is both a reliable and simple means for a female to maximize the benefits of polyandry. Females can also use palpation and antennation before mating to deduce whether or not a mate is novel.</p>\\n<p><u>Economic importance</u><br />\\n\\tGryllus bimaculatus is widely used by suppliers of live crickets for feeding to pet and zoo animals.</p>\\n</div>\\n",

Its bill is long, straight, and slender. The adult male has an iridescent crimson-red derived from magenta to a reddish-pink crown and gorget, which can look dull brown or gray without direct sunlight and a dark, slightly forked tail. Females also have iridescent red gorgets, though they are usually smaller and less brilliant than the males\'. Anna\'s is the only North American hummingbird species with a red crown. Females and juvenile males have a dull green crown, a grey throat with or without some red iridescence, a grey chest and belly, and a dark, rounded tail with white tips on the outer feathers.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">These birds feed on nectar from flowers using a long extendable tongue. They also consume small insects and other arthropods caught in flight or gleaned from vegetation. A PBS documentary shows how Anna\'s hummingbirds eat flying insects. They aim for the flying insect, then open their beaks to capture the prey.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">While collecting nectar, they also assist in plant pollination. This species sometimes consumes tree sap. The male\'s call is scratchy and metallic, and it perches above head-level in trees and shrubs. They are frequently seen in backyards and parks, and commonly found at feeders and flowering plants.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Anna\'s hummingbirds can shake their bodies 55 times per second to shed rain while in flight, or in dry weather, to remove pollen or dirt from feathers.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Reproduction</strong><br />\\r\\n\\tOpen-wooded or shrubby areas and mountain meadows along the Pacific coast from British Columbia to Arizona make up C. anna\'s breeding habitat. The female raises the young without the assistance of the male. The female bird builds a nest in a shrub or tree, in vines, or attached to wires or other artificial substrates. The round, 3.8-to-5.1-centimetre (1.5 to 2.0 in) diameter nest is constructed of plant fibers, downy feathers and animal hair; the exterior is camouflaged with chips of lichen, plant debris, and occasionally urban detritus such as paint chips and cigarette paper. The nest materials are bound together with spider silk. They are known to nest as early as mid-December and as late as June, depending on geographic location and climatic conditions.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Unlike most northern temperate hummingbirds, the male Anna\'s hummingbird sings during courtship. The song is thin and squeaky, interspersed with buzzes and chirps, and is drawn to over 10 seconds in duration. During the breeding season, males can be observed performing an aerial display dive over their territories. The males also use the dive display to drive away rivals or intruders of other species. When a female flies onto a male\'s territory, he rises up about 130 ft (40 m) before diving over the recipient. As he approaches the bottom of the dive, the male reaches an average speed of 27 m/s (89 ft/s), which is 385 body lengths per second. At the bottom of the dive, the male travels 23 m/s (51 mph), and produces a loud sound described by some as an \\"explosive squeak\\" with his outer tail-feathers.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Anna\'s hummingbirds hybridize fairly frequently with other species, especially the congeneric Costa\'s hummingbird. These natural hybrids have been mistaken for new species. A bird, allegedly collected in Bolaños, Mexico, was described and named Selasphorus floresii (Gould, 1861), or Floresi\'s hummingbird. Several more specimens were collected in California over a long period, and the species was considered extremely rare. The specimens were the hybrid offspring of an Anna\'s hummingbird and an Allen\'s hummingbird. A single bird collected in Santa Barbara, California, was described and named Trochilus violajugulum (Jeffries, 1888), or violet-throated hummingbird. It was later determined to be a hybrid between an Anna\'s hummingbird and a black-chinned hummingbird.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Locomotion</strong><br />\\r\\n\\tDuring hovering flight, Anna\'s hummingbirds maintain high wingbeat frequencies accomplished by their large pectoral muscles via recruitment of motor units. The pectoral muscles that power hummingbird flight are composed exclusively of fast glycolytic fibers that respond rapidly and are fatigue-resistant.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Distribution</strong><br />\\r\\n\\tAnna\'s hummingbirds are found along the western coast of North America, from southern Canada to northern Baja California, and inland to southern and central Arizona, extreme southern Nevada and southeastern Utah, and western Texas. They tend to be permanent residents within their range, and are very territorial. However, birds have been spotted far outside their range in such places as southern Alaska, Saskatchewan, New York, Florida, Louisiana, and Newfoundland.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Anna\'s hummingbirds have the northernmost year-round range of any hummingbird. During cold temperatures, Anna\'s hummingbirds gradually gain weight during the day as they convert sugar to fat. In addition, hummingbirds with inadequate stores of body fat or insufficient plumage are able to survive periods of subfreezing weather by lowering their metabolic rate and entering a state of torpor.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The population of Anna\'s hummingbirds is an estimated 1.5 million, which appears to be stable, and they are not considered an endangered species.</p>\\r\\n<hr />\\r\\n<p><strong>Reference</strong><br />\\r\\n\\t<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna%27s_hummingbird\\" target=\\"_blank\\">wikipedia</a></p>\\r\\n",

The female raises the young without the assistance of the male. The female bird builds a nest in a shrub or tree, in vines, or attached to wires or other artificial substrates. The round, 3.8-to-5.1-centimetre (1.5 to 2.0 in) diameter nest is constructed of plant fibers, downy feathers and animal hair; the exterior is camouflaged with chips of lichen, plant debris, and occasionally urban detritus such as paint chips and cigarette paper. The nest materials are bound together with spider silk. They are known to nest as early as mid-December and as late as June, depending on geographic location and climatic conditions.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Unlike most northern temperate hummingbirds, the male Anna\'s hummingbird sings during courtship. The song is thin and squeaky, interspersed with buzzes and chirps, and is drawn to over 10 seconds in duration. During the breeding season, males can be observed performing an aerial display dive over their territories. The males also use the dive display to drive away rivals or intruders of other species. When a female flies onto a male\'s territory, he rises up about 130 ft (40 m) before diving over the recipient. As he approaches the bottom of the dive, the male reaches an average speed of 27 m/s (89 ft/s), which is 385 body lengths per second. At the bottom of the dive, the male travels 23 m/s (51 mph), and produces a loud sound described by some as an \\"explosive squeak\\" with his outer tail-feathers.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Anna\'s hummingbirds hybridize fairly frequently with other species, especially the congeneric Costa\'s hummingbird. These natural hybrids have been mistaken for new species. A bird, allegedly collected in Bolaños, Mexico, was described and named Selasphorus floresii (Gould, 1861), or Floresi\'s hummingbird. Several more specimens were collected in California over a long period, and the species was considered extremely rare. The specimens were the hybrid offspring of an Anna\'s hummingbird and an Allen\'s hummingbird. A single bird collected in Santa Barbara, California, was described and named Trochilus violajugulum (Jeffries, 1888), or violet-throated hummingbird. It was later determined to be a hybrid between an Anna\'s hummingbird and a black-chinned hummingbird.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Locomotion</strong><br />\\n\\tDuring hovering flight, Anna\'s hummingbirds maintain high wingbeat frequencies accomplished by their large pectoral muscles via recruitment of motor units. The pectoral muscles that power hummingbird flight are composed exclusively of fast glycolytic fibers that respond rapidly and are fatigue-resistant.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\"><strong>Distribution</strong><br />\\n\\tAnna\'s hummingbirds are found along the western coast of North America, from southern Canada to northern Baja California, and inland to southern and central Arizona, extreme southern Nevada and southeastern Utah, and western Texas. They tend to be permanent residents within their range, and are very territorial. However, birds have been spotted far outside their range in such places as southern Alaska, Saskatchewan, New York, Florida, Louisiana, and Newfoundland.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">Anna\'s hummingbirds have the northernmost year-round range of any hummingbird. During cold temperatures, Anna\'s hummingbirds gradually gain weight during the day as they convert sugar to fat. In addition, hummingbirds with inadequate stores of body fat or insufficient plumage are able to survive periods of subfreezing weather by lowering their metabolic rate and entering a state of torpor.</p>\\n<p class=\\"rtejustify\\">The population of Anna\'s hummingbirds is an estimated 1.5 million, which appears to be stable, and they are not considered an endangered species.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p><strong>Reference</strong><br />\\n\\t<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna%27s_hummingbird\\" target=\\"_blank\\">wikipedia</a></p>\\n",

The second dorsal fin and the anal fin, as well as the finlets between those fins and the tail, are bright yellow, giving this fish its common name. The second dorsal and anal fins can be very long in mature specimens, reaching almost as far back as the tail and giving the appearance of sickles or scimitars. The pectoral fins are also longer than the related bluefin tuna, but not as long as those of the albacore. The main body is a very dark metallic blue, changing to silver on the belly, which has about 20 vertical lines. Reported sizes in the literature have ranged as high as 2.4 m (94 in) in length and 200 kg (440 lb) in weight. The International Game Fish Association (IGFA) record for this species stands at 176 kg (388 lb)for a fish caught in 1977 near San Benedicto Island in the Pacific waters of Mexico. In 2010, a 184-kg yellowfin was caught off the tip of Mexico\'s Baja Peninsula, 2.2-metre (87 in) long with a girth of 1.5 m (59 in). The catch is still pending verification by the IGFA. In 2012, a fisherman in Baja California caught a 193-kg yellowfin. If the catch is confirmed by the IGFA, the fisherman will receive a prize of $1 million.</p>\\r\\n<div class=\\"more\\">\\r\\n\\t<p>Habitat<br />\\r\\n\\t\\tYellowfin tuna are epipelagic fish that inhabit the mixed surface layer of the ocean above the thermocline. Sonic tracking has found that although yellowfin tuna, unlike the related bigeye tuna, mostly range in the top 100 m (330 ft) of the water column and penetrate the thermocline relatively infrequently, they are capable of diving to considerable depths. An individual tagged in the Indian Ocean with an archival tag spent 85% of its time in depths shallower than 75 m (246 ft), but was recorded as having made three dives to 578, 982, and 1,160 m (3,810 ft).</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>Behavior<br />\\r\\n\\t\\tAlthough mainly found in deep offshore waters, yellowfin tuna may approach shore when suitable conditions exist. Mid-ocean islands such as the Hawaiian archipelago, other island groups in the Western Pacific, Caribbean, and Maldives islands Indian Ocean, as well as the volcanic islands of the Atlantic such as Ascension Island and Saint Helena, often harbor yellowfin feeding on the baitfish these spots concentrate close to the shoreline. Yellowfin may venture well inshore of the continental shelf when water temperature and clarity are suitable and food is abundant. Yellowfin tuna often travel in schools with similarly sized companions. They sometimes school with other tuna species and mixed schools of small yellowfin, and skipjack tuna, in particular, are commonplace. They are often associated with various species of dolphins or porpoises, as well as with larger marine creatures such as whales and whale sharks. They also associate with drifting flotsam such as logs and pallets, and sonic tagging indicates some follow moving vessels. Hawaiian yellowfins associate with anchored fish aggregation devices and with certain sections of the 50-fathom curve.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>Diet and predation<br />\\r\\n\\t\\tYellowfin tuna prey include other fish, pelagic crustaceans, and squid. Like all tunas, their body shape is particularly adapted for speed, enabling them to pursue and capture fast-moving baitfish such as flying fish, sauries, and mackerel. Schooling species such as myctophids or lanternfish and similar pelagic driftfish, anchovies, and sardines are frequently taken. Large yellowfins prey on smaller members of the tuna family such as frigate mackerel and skipjack tuna. In turn, yellowfin are preyed upon when young by other pelagic hunters, including larger tuna, seabirds, and predatory fishes such as wahoo, shark, and billfish. Adults are threatened only by the largest and fastest hunters, such as toothed whales, particularly the false killer whale, pelagic sharks such as the mako and great white, large Atlantic blue marlin and Pacific blue marlin, and black marlin. The main source of mortality, however, is industrial tuna fisheries. Yellowfins are able to escape most predators, because unlike most fish, tuna are warm-blooded, and their warm muscles make them extremely strong swimmers, with yellowfin tuna reaching \\"speeds of up to 50 miles per hour\\".
